positive,Work great and look good
positive,"You are going to be VERY happy if you select this set to replace your OEM rear brakes.  Smooth, quiet stopping power, thanks to the ceramic / carbon pads that are matched to this set.  They pay for themselves when you safely avoid your first collision, road hazard or speed trap.  Sure, only about 30% of braking power comes from the rear brakes, but sometimes, that's the difference between shiny or twisted metal...or worse.  At this price, about the same as cutting rotors and putting inferior, semi-metallic pads in at a chain garage.<br /><br />This set returns the safety and power of a four-wheel disc system to your ride.  If your rims show rotors, these oversize, vented and slotted discs are beautiful and have more than enough stopping power for urban driving and non-knucklehead performance driving.  Exact fit, with new clips to ease installation."
positive,Very easy to add to vehicle pour spout made into bottle. Good quality oil uv light activated to find leaks
positive,"Extra storage for phone, drink, and glasses.  Perfect for our needs."
negative,"This stuff is hard for me to review because I am a new user and wont know how effective it is for a long time. I used it on my spark plugs and if all goes well this product should make the next change a whole lot easier. The one thing I CAN review is the amount they make you buy. Unless this is made for mechanics who own large shops or dealerships that work on a lot of vehicles the amount is just crazy! When you use it on whatever you choose to use it on it doesnt take much, very little in fact. So...an 8oz bottle of it should last long after Im gone, then on to my children, their childrens childrens grandchildren, probably even longer? Sell a 1oz or maybe 1/2oz size, I would pay a few bucks for it."
positive,The pump is powerful and quiet.<br />QUALITY PARTS.<br />Small and easy to store.
positive,These work great in my Fiamma F35 pro. I just set it up for the first time today and was happy to see that it fit the C-channel.
positive,"This cover is hard to get on, even after sitting in the heat of the car, but once it is on it stays on well and is adorable."
positive,Great and awesome quality.
positive,"My wife was skeptical before I bought it, loves it now!"
positive,"I like how it looks and the size. I'm less confident about the red fading or chipping away, but I've had it a few weeks now with no problem and it'll probably last a long time before that starts happening. If it does start to fade or chip, I'll update my review."
negative,"So first one I received I couldn't get to fit.  Second one was the same but decided there must have been a problem with the rear plastic mold.  I had to use some serious force to jam the aluminum cross member into the plastic.  Since I still had the first one I tried on it and it wouldn't go, therefore there is something that does not fit quite right for the rear you may or may not have this problem.  The fronts fit a little looser and no problem with adjustment.<br />The rear also caused me some problems with the screws not lining up right."
positive,"I absolutely love these running  boards. They came undamaged, which is always a nice surprise. Installation was extremely easy. I watched the install video online and never even had to look at the directions. It probably took me about an hour at most to install. I used a ratchet set. If I had power tools it would have been done in half the time. I did snap one bolt that connects the running board to the mount. Just tightened it to much I guess. There are still five other bolts holding it on and it's very solid. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for high quality boards for a very reasonable price."
positive,This is a really good organizer! Just the right size and holds all my trunk stuff with room to spare. It's nice and sturdy and fit in my 2016 Focus SE really well. Now I'm looking pretty darn organized. Sweet!
negative,"Kind of thin and not as soft and comfortable as others I have from retail stores, but it does the job and I don't feel like returning them. I don't recommend."
positive,Properly secured the battery in my truck.  This is an OEM quality fit and finish.
negative,"I have several gas cans.  On some of the older ones the spout leaks.  I've tried with and without the strainer.  On my new cans it seems to work fine.  The vent tends to pop open unless you close it just right.  You must drill the can to install the vent.  You need a drill bit a bit larger than 1/2 inch.  I didn't have one, so I used the 1/2 inch and just used the bit to open the hole just a bit.  It would be nice if they came with instructions on what size drill to use.  Honestly, the vent is the best part.  Just install the vent and use the spout that came with the newer style cans.  The newer ""spill proof"" cans spill more gas than they pour, and they pour so slow it is redicilious."
positive,Great item
positive,Update still working great
positive,$247.99 at Harbor Freight on Black Friday 2022.<br /><br />Weighs 103 lbs. Might not be low enough for some vehicles. I expect it will last longer than i will.
positive,"I am amazed at how well this product worked.  I have a lovely Ital Sofa pit group, but the problem was, that the store had been unable to get the matching ottoman that fit, so they dyed a copper colored one they had in the store.  So, after years of use, the copper began bleeding through, and the ottoman didn't just have a few glitches, it was a mess.<br /><br />At first I didn't think it was working, but I wasn't doing it right.  You need to use a lot and dab, rather than wipe, and I used several coats.  The ottoman is as good as new, and I feel very pleased with  myself, as I am not the crafty project type, but anyone can use this."
positive,I love these. This is a replacement for the identical ones I had that finally wore out. These are wonderful!!
positive,Convertible canvas top
positive,"Worked really well on our lawn mower, delivering was fast"
positive,Love this item. Holds a lot of trash and is easy to dump.
positive,"Just received my order today, placed it in the bathroom WOW what a scent. Lit up my whole bathroom. My neighbor came over she said what's that smelling so good. And she wasn't even in the bathroom. Lavender & Rose together smell so good. Will buy again when the scent leaves. Thank you so much."
positive,"Real good cleaner for leather, the conditioner was also very good and left a ""new car"" smell. Highly recommended."
positive,Glasses worked exactly as I predicted. Probably will buy some for my friend. Worked good in the day & night.
positive,Super easy to install! I’ve had sun shades before but they are so freakin painfully cumbersome that I end up not using them. I have had mine for a few months and use it every-single-day! I live in FL where you can’t put your bare legs on the car seat because it’s so hot… this thing really works!!! My car is actually bearable when opening the door on a hot day.
positive,"Very sturdy.  This is a quality product.  I bought it for my son's car, which didn't have a bracket for his license plate.  It does not come with the bolts, so I also purchased a kit of &#34;locking fasteners&#34; with plastic grommets.  The combination of products worked perfectly together."
negative,Burnt out first use on lawnmower.
negative,I have had this blower for only around 6 months and it is starting to make an even worse noise than the factory original. Save your money and time and just buy an OEM part. I will be purchasing a factory part soon to replace this cheap replacement.
positive,"Amazing product! I wanted these to develop my abdominal section more, not necessarily for back issues.  They are comfortable and I can hang for a few minutes before I really start to feel the pull on my ankles.  I wear high cushioned socks when snapping them in because there is a slight pinch against my skin, but very far from a deal-breaker.  I picked these up based on a recommendation and am glad I did!"
positive,Easily swapped out and now headlights work perfectly
positive,I’m happy with the item I ordered.
positive,I used this product at a job I had when very young; it is made in Germany and works on any metal for polishing/cleaning. It's amazing how just a small amt can clean the dirtiest metal and make it look brand new again. Was so glad to find this on Amazon!
positive,"Sweet little garage companion. Rolls very easily on the concrete and most hard surfaces. The downside as I see it... the cushion is not all that soft, the foam isn't real 'cushy' and is easily compressed by your butt so you are actually sitting on the supporting board.  But then again, it is not used as a lounge chair."
positive,It’s common on BMW X3 F25 for the taillights to stop working. I originally took the original chip out and soldered it back which lasted about 1.5 years then the entire left side went out.<br /><br />I purchased this in the four pack and installed two chips on the left side that resolved my issue. It is an extremely easy install and so far I haven’t had any key fob frequency interference.<br /><br />Only time will tell how long this will last if I keep the vehicle long enough I’ll do an update if I have an issue. You do not need to buy an entirely new taillight. Either solder your original chip or better yet buy these for a plug and play install.
positive,"I had black belt transfer from my &#34;black leather belt&#34;, to my seats on my Ford Truck. The light leather seats picked up the color and would not come out. Most of the stain came out, I believe more would have, had I found this a year ago. It's a good product and I tested a ball point pin mark on a back section of same leather. It completely came out.  It's powerful stuff, and I would pay attention to all instructions!"
positive,"These handles are breaking my heart! They look great, but a couple of them are starting to stick when you push in the button, the doors still close securely but the button doesn't pop back out, I've seen a couple reviews that say the same thing and I'm probably gonna have to take doors apart again and sand off the pin mechanism, it has black paint that reviews say is the part sticking. These things are VERY tedious to install. I removed the doors and installed inside on a table. Once you get door panels off you have cut out a hole in the inner plastic panel to get to the nuts that hold on the factory handles. If you drop a screw while screwing into new handles, good luck! It falls into the bottom of the door and near impossible to retrieve. I learned quickly to use a magnet connected to the end of the Allen wrench. Took about 4 hours for four doors...back gate, add another hour, more difficult, have to remove part of the old handle and install it to the new handle, and have to be a contortionist to reach one of the screws because it's behind the latch mechanism, But it's do-able and looks great after it's all done."
positive,Good
positive,"I have used KYB struts and shocks for years and I think they are the best value (price & quality) on the market. KYB is one of the OEM suppliers, the other being Showa, for the Japanese car manufacturers. This is my first set of the AGX model struts. The AGX models are a performance strut with a compression adjustment on the top so the firmness of the ride can be tailored to your liking. I installed them on my 2002 Honda Civic EX sedan. Everything fit perfectly and I used my stock springs. My baseline setting on the compression adjustment was left at the factory setting of #2 out of 4 settings. Overall I am very pleased with the struts. I have 4 KYB Gas-a-Just® shocks on my Nissan truck too. The truck has 185K miles and the KYB shocks have been on it 155K miles without any problems."
positive,Great value.  I use this in the harsh winters to get the ice off my car's window.  Larger size can.
positive,I really like them !
positive,Very tight fit and a decent gauge.
positive,"Thank you Dr. Sheepskin!  I put one on my seatbelt, and one on the strap of my leather book satchel.  Such an easy solution for both!  They fit both items perfectly.  Genuine leather inside, soft sheep wool outside, nice and thick, soft, cozy.  Velcro closure - and has a flap along one edge that helps grip, so it doesn't rotate around the seat belt or strap.  Works beautifully!"
positive,just as ordered.  Perfect
positive,The order was easy to place and I received all the parts order. The most important thing was that the parts fitted my vehicle perfectly. Sorry I don't have pics of them because they are all in the vehicle.
positive,This was pretty easy to put on my car.  I have a U-shaped arm and it pretty much just slid right on.  I cleaned the windshield with it and it didn't leave any streaks.  It's been such a dry summer though that it might be a while before there's an actual rain shower to try it out in.
positive,"This product did the trick on my tracks in the garage, we have screened sliders that would stick, sprayed this product andViola"
positive,The hooks make it easy to keep the levers in place while removing the tire. Another wonderfully thought out product from Park Tool.
positive,"This brand is total quality, easy to use and the Seller was and sent exactly what was advertised and what I bought...The product was also shipped and delivered ON TIME"
negative,"I will likely switch this out for an emergency road kit I compile myself, or for one by AAA. The kit is probably good for 1 emergency so it's better than nothing at all. The first issue I had was that a portion of the reflective triangle has peeled off of the storage bag, so much so that a small part of it has now broken off. Another reviewer mentioned the narrow gauge of the jumper cables, that concerns me a great deal. They might be safe for one use, but I would recommend replacing them as soon as you can.<br /><br />Some of the items would be helpful, though again I'd replace them with something sturdier. The blanket, rain poncho & work gloves would be handy items. I have never had good results with the tire sealant, so I don't see myself trying it.<br /><br />There are better emergency kits out there, and tons of info online for creating your own. I would pass this kit up and try one of those instead. I'll use this kit since I have nothing else at the moment, but I'm replacing it as soon as I can."
positive,Perfect for for my 2010 Kia Soul! Also surprisingly easy to put on my car. Great price!
positive,"It's pretty good, the results are good if you understand how to use it ! Practice few times to see how it works and then you will understand want I want to say.<br />I don't have to wash the shower doors so often like before."
positive,Rain gets pushed away
positive,good
negative,Not weather proof
positive,"Purchase this to insulate my stakol/costway  12v fridge. Fits like a glove, has openings for the wheel and exhaust."
positive,Great item
positive,"Vozada 2 in 1 Chenille Microfiber Car Wash Mop Mitt with 33"" Aluminum Alloy Long Handle,Brush Duster Not Hurt Paint Scratch Free Cleaning Tool for Washing Car,Truck, RV (Gray)<br /><br />So far so good. This has really helped me washing our 4Runner. It washes well and stays soft."
positive,"Nice product, it worked well."
positive,Great price and quick shipping
positive,Work great for that little extra length needed with a lift
positive,Arrived quickly and was very easy to assemble. So far it has worked great as of now I have used mostly as a stool  it is comfortable and moves around easily
positive,good
positive,I put this on my car right when it arrived and it was very easy to install. I have had this on my car for over a year now and it is missing a few rhinestones and obviously isn't as shiny as it once was. But other than that it has held up nicely
negative,"Cheap metal , buy better quality !"
positive,Excellent service and excellent item
positive,Really brightens up our dining area.
positive,Same as you get from Walmart
positive,"it looks ok , will use it in the future."
positive,works great
positive,"Fit perfectly but measured it several times to make sure it would fit. Hardest thing was cutting out the area for the cargo lights. I've had this type of bedliner before, the plastic is thick enough to last the life of the truck. Was the least expensive one I could find & am very satisfied with it. When you order it the shipping company calls you to verify your vehicle. Was easy to install with my wife's help."
positive,Great product. Used in conjunction with a 390-400nm wavelength ultraviolet flashlight.
negative,"This product is really labor intensive. You have to do little areas at a time, to avoid a chalky residue. The little tiny pad included to apply the product is a joke. A guy with big hands would have a difficult time using it. It's about the size of a compact make-up pad! It didn't last very long (2-3 weeks), and I live in the mild northwest, and  we didn't have a lot of rain, and no hot days, after I applied it  I'll use it up, but I'm going back to Maguire's. Better product, better price."
negative,[[VIDEOID:29c796e1b7a21bd959c8599efb48fa09]] This took almost a month to get to me with one day shipping. then when it does finally get here it is growing mold inside. I love pro soap it is the only soap that can get my husbands mechanic hands clean but this is disgusting...
positive,Really cool and easy to hook up . We'll built also .
negative,"Solid construction. Makes a good step into truck bed. But it has one big downside---it is way too small for a 2 inch hitch--it wobbles all over the place like nothing I have ever put in a hitch receiver before. Should you consider this product, you might want to look at getting a stabilizing attachment for it to reduce all the free play and clunking noise you would otherwise get. If it were not for this problem this would be a 4 star item."
positive,Convenient and works!
positive,Great accent to my Jeep and good quality
positive,Good stuff.  Good value.  It doesn't dry out over time so this tube will last me several years
positive,Took me 25min  to install pipes and set up fulpak. And she purrs like a kitten and pulls hard
positive,"Works great, fast shipping."
positive,The price great<br />works well<br />great quality
positive,Fantastic. Has a great feel to it and totally changed the old steering wheel into a fabulous piece of equipment.
negative,Do not fit well in center console. Come out easily.
positive,"This totally worked! My 12 year old car has never been deep cleaned. Even after washing, there is a layer of bumpy grime that keeps my car from looking smooth and shiny. I spent about 2 hours rubbing this clay bar on my car and it shows! The finish is SMOOTH and extremely SHINY. I then used the VW paint pen to fill in the paint chips and finished it off with Nu Finish wax and my car looks like new. This product made the all the diffence."
positive,"Easy install.  Stopped leaking on my old pump/grommet.  Sprays 100 x better than old pump, as well.  Very happy, so far."
positive,easy install
positive,"I bought these for my husband for Father's Day since he's a huge Bears fan. They match perfectly with the other Bears accessories I've been collecting for his car. He loves them. They're really nice looking. I also like that since they are warm and soft, they add a little comfy cushion onto the front of your seat belt while you're wearing it. These are such a good gift and not very expensive either."
positive,"this is a well made light bar. It comes with the hardware and brackets needed to install. My brother was tempted to put it on his SUV but decided to install it on the large tractor he uses for ploughing in the winter. Installation was straightforward and there were no issues or problems. the unit provides an amazing amount of bright light. this will be a big help when he plows at night or in the dark, early morning hours. Seems well made; not a cheap plastic unit. It is too early to report on durability but so far we are very pleased."
positive,Fit perfectly! 2008 BMW 328ix
positive,Perfect fit!  The one I got and made was too thick.
positive,Great product
positive,Very bright!
positive,was impressed with quality and price.
positive,"Was in a bind so I bought them from the auto parts store, but these WILL work on a 2014 Grand Cherokee. They spray a bit higher than the factory ones, but in my opinion they're better. Oh...and Amazon is cheaper than the auto parts store."
positive,"Time will tell if my efforts, keeping my oil changed consistently will have a positive effect. This oil so far appears to work."
positive,"I cannot praise this product enough.  Brief back-story: I'm a single girl trying to make it in this crazy world.  When my low tire pressure light came on and didn't go away (sometimes it goes away, sometimes I'm not so lucky) I decided action finally needed to be taken.  I promptly went to a gas station where I discovered that a) $0.75 for air seems a little steep, and b) I had no idea what I was doing.  I didn't have a pressure gauge with me so I didn't know if I was over inflating, under inflating, doing nothing, etc.  Cut to trusty Amazon where I used my mobile app on site and ordered this baby immediately.<br /><br />It arrived in a few days and though I was not impressed with the packaging (my box was opened and the outside of the actual product was slightly scuffed) I figured I would tough it out.  The instructions are easy to follow and the digital display easy to read.  All you do is plug it into your car adapter, set it to correct pressure amount, attach the tube and let 'er rip.  I was a little confused at first when the display showed a lower number when I screwed the tube on and figured it didn't &#34;stick&#34; to the pre-set number.  I soon realized it first shows what your pressure is actually at before it starts filling and you can watch it go up.  Once it reaches the pre-set number it turns itself off and you can move on the next tire.  I filled up all four tires in less than 20 minutes and could not even begin to tell you how awesome I felt for my accomplishment.  It's a little loud when you run it but that's to be expected with any tire inflator.  I now keep this bad boy in my trunk, ready to be pulled into action at a moments notice."
positive,bought these to pull out my sierra 1500 and attached them to a kinetic rope as it was a long dirt run (80 ft). worked beautifully and the safety latch is worth having as it could save your body/limbs/windows/bodywork.
positive,Well made. Good leather. Should last a life time.
positive,Item is a lot better made then i expected<br />It's very heavy duty<br />I would definitely recommend this product to anyone...
negative,"Do not buy,  unit did not work straight out the box all the lights turn on but the pump does not work and seller refuses to refund"
positive,Fit like it was supposed to
positive,"No fit correctly on my 2003 Xterra, but it turns out fine. Also the 2 front foot mat does not look like the pictures shown. :( I was hoping they send in the one like the pictures probably will fit better."
negative,I gave it 2 stars because of the price. I ordered 2 and they both broke.
positive,"Did it's job well! Twists on, filters oil, keeps me on the road!"
positive,"You could use this to get a few more inches of reach on your trailer wiring, or as I did cut it in half and use it to replace a failed one.<br />Good price, nice wire, tight fit."
positive,Nice controller.
negative,Looks like a very useful tow bracket
positive,Fantastic product definitely worth it
negative,To narrow. Not much room to adjust; mirror to long for short mount post.
positive,I bought a set of these wipers and they are easy to install and work great!
positive,Looks Great! Great Price!
negative,It is too early to tell how well it works because the fumes would not allow the gas pump to completely fill the tank.
positive,"I can not say how accurate they are for sure since I dont have a good standard to compare, but my opinion is that they are accurate based on other cheap gauges and my experience with tires. Its fantastic but sometimes the chuck is a stubborn about locking on to a specific valve and I dont know why. However when it does lock, it makes life so much easier. I would buy again"
positive,Good price
positive,Make sure you use the one on the right seat.  The seat cover will be marked airbag
positive,My husband replace this part on our trailer and now the door is working fine!
positive,Work perfect!
positive,"So far they work perfect, love the red color too. So much cheaper than the stealership!"
positive,NGK's have been very reliable for me.  I use them on all my hyundai's
positive,Easy to stall
positive,Great!
negative,"Very flimsy, breaks easy."
positive,Fit great.
positive,"works, should have check with Amazon in the first place to find! Caps that came with containers ""politically correct"" to comply with ambulance chasing lawers."
positive,"Awesome. It's good quality. Shipped quickly, and looks great on my car."
positive,This works great on our 5th wheel RV.
negative,Get what you pay for I guess. Product looks great. Feels solid and seems to be a good product for the price.<br />Problem: It's advertised as fitting a 3.5 inch exhaust and there is no way it clamps down that far. Inside diameter of the clamp is 3 5/8 and it clamps less than a 16th. I was really hoping to save welding it on but it looks like that is my only option.
positive,It didn’t work for what I needed I was trying to repair a crack in my windshield but that’s not to say it wouldn’t work for something else
positive,Twenty minutes to install and fixed the trouble I had starting my 2003 Sonata after refueling. Thank you to YouTube!!
negative,"Wouldn't stay in place, good craftmanship, prompt delivery"
positive,"Works great!  Better than the other ones I've tried them all,  sham wow,  meguiars,  mothers,  etc...  Only one that tops this one is the chemical brother super absorbent micro fiber towels,  but. U get what you pay for!  Awesome for the $"
positive,better and cheaper than the ones they were trying to sell me at the RV store<br />Would recommend them
positive,This is way better than the ones made out of that space-blanket material or the ones that look like aluminum bubble wrap.<br /><br />Love this product so far and it's a perfect fit for my Ford Transit 150 van. Probably going to buy another one for an F-350.
positive,"product matched perfect with automobile, quality and less expensive"
positive,I thought the &#34;rubber bands&#34; would be hokey or inconvenient.  They actually work great.  This should take nearly every phone size.  Mounts tight and hasn't loosened over 300 miles so far. Easy to adjust on the fly.  This is a fine product.
positive,"Arrived on time and as expected.  Produce is, thus far, working as advertised and expected."
positive,Delivered Fast and will come in handy.  Very Snug Fit and not likely to come off.
positive,"These seem to do the job. They are a very tight fit on my Honda CRV, but they do seem to stay in place. Like other reviewers have said, the fabric is fairly thin. My truck has waterproof seat covers of a thicker fabric and I am used to them. No spills yet to test the repellency of the covers."
positive,Quality is good. Fit my stock radiator cap. Fitment exactly like stock.
positive,I LOVE THESE &#34;WALLS&#34;!! These are perfect for the back of my Jeep.
positive,This is my go to engine oil for my one-owner 1999 Subaru Forester.  Of all the oils I've tried this one has the least consumption between oil changes.  Priced right too.  Great value.
positive,Perfect for my go cart and mini bike!!
negative,"EZ install, had failed annual inspection due to being out so bought this one, passed inspection. Fast forward 1 year, failed again due to being out, so lasted between 2-365 days."
positive,"TBSS here, worked great for replacing factory manifold flange studs"
positive,Did a great job when painting the roof of the camper.
positive,fir great work really well. easy to put on.
positive,Definitely helped get my fan get a lot more balanced than what it was. I have feeling my fan ceiling box may also be an issue but these help take a lot of the swaying out and I can finally sleep at night without the clanging of the fan. Takes awhile to properly find the fan blade(s) that are out of balance but that was expected. I ended up putting a single weight on 2 separate blades that were next to each other.
positive,Good
positive,Perfect fit. Works like it should!
negative,Did not like them
positive,"For the amount of quality items, you can't beat the price! If i had another vehicle, I'd buy another one!!!"
positive,I have a 2015 Jetta. It covers the windshield for the most part.<br />Folding was a bit tricky at first.<br />Car is definitely cooler than with the accordion one I had.
positive,Just what I needed my original mirror got damaged from the sun. This replacement one was great.
positive,Great for smaller vehicles. Solid purchase that adheres well. Hopefully I find a larger EGA for my truck.
positive,"Installed on top of ""faded"" rear mirror  of our convertible. excellent result"
positive,nice tool kit. Thanks
negative,"Not sure we got the right set for our truck, look too small and I am not really happy. I will say they are made of quality rubber and thick."
positive,Really easy putting these on my Tractor. I would buy them again. Longevity who knows??
positive,Very much liked how newer technology was implemented on these wheel locks.  Much safer than previous models or other brands.
positive,"There is not much to say about battery cables, but when you need some these are great. Good quality materials with terminals well fitted. Good value."
positive,"Genius! My things no longer fall into the street or roll under the truck when I open the tailgate, backdoor, whatever its called...to my Jeep."
positive,"We have a 2010 JK and these taillights replaced the stock ones. My husband installed them in five minutes flat, which included disassembling the old. Super easy to use, look great, and work like a charm!!"
positive,Look and fit great
negative,"Ordered red, received green. Chain is plastic and melted plastic to hold it in place. Yes, low quality. Priced too high for quality. Worth $2-3 max."
negative,"Doesn't fit my car, even though I checked through Amazon's page. Mirror is right size but the larger, circular plastic on the back doesn't attach to any part of my vehicle."
positive,Perfect
positive,"Installation is through a hole less than half the diameter of these and these are stiff. The zip ties included are just used as a joke, remove them from back and toss in the nearest rubbish tin. Now find a large enough hose clamp and use that to crush these mutha's down far enough to barely go through the hole in the bottom of the A-arm (with the help of liberal application of silicone spray). You can only get a few inches at a time, then move the hose clamp down, re-tighten, force more in, repeat. Had to use a scissor jack to press the bottom of the bag up enough to get the bottom plastic washer in. All in all, took about two-hours, but what a total b*tch of a time to do it. Holy carp..., don't wanna do that job again!"
positive,"We bought this to clean up an area we were trying to repair a scratch on the interior of our car. While the scratch was too deep to be taken away completely, this restored the area around where we had been trying to fix it, making it visible only when you look closely rather than being the first thing you see. I’m super happy with the results!"
negative,Could do the same thing cracking window and spraying air freshener in while a/c running.  Not really a good value or very nice scent.
positive,These things are wonderful.  Things are no longer sliding around in my trunk when I make a fast turn.  I love them and will be gifting them to my friends and family.
positive,"My engine was spilling oil and I had to read online to discover it could be a bad PCV valve. I got this with the grommet (both for less than 12 bucks). It took a little bit of effort to pry out the grommet, but once this was installed, I took it for a drive on the highway and it was so good!"
positive,Cute mandala sticker. Happy with purchase. Vibrant colors!
negative,"I received this item unopened, but damaged and didn't clip into one of my driver side clips I made it work because I wasn't spending my time trying to re box it up they refused to give me any type of refund or compensation. It does it job otherwise. Just dispointed how it arrived. Was all bent and cut slits."
positive,"This cabin air filter is a much better quality than the original filter that came in my car. It is at least twice as thick, and very sturdy. Installation in my 2020 GMC Acadia was easy, and took just 3 minutes using a T15 Torx screwdriver bit. I highly recommend this cabin air filter. It is excellent quality at a very good price!"
positive,Fits perfect.
positive,exellent
positive,Works Great and dont have to worry about steel splinters from a cable
positive,Really bright and well built. The light and mounting hardware are a lot stouter than I was expecting. I haven't compared it to one of the high dollar ones but for the money it is well worth it.
positive,Added some pop to the dash - Easy to install and love them so far
positive,"was concerned if they would stay on in storms since no additional tie down or hook straps.  Well, they were still there after sitting in storage for 4 months and after 8 months use they still look great."
positive,A+
positive,Great
positive,Great item. Very easy to install looks really good on my black Jeep and protects those spots where the mirror can damage. Great stuff
negative,"I have Goodyear Kevlar Wrangler tires that have some curb rash.  Interestingly the rash is white underneath the black wall.  After cleaning and drying, I sprayed the rash on 3 different occasions and none of them adhered to the tire.  Did not work for me."
positive,"this product has not worked from the day I bought it. just put it in the trunk of my car until I recently needed it and it would not work. please send me another one or refund my money. joseph patti, pattijoseph@yahoo.com"
positive,Perfect for the second row seat in our Mazda Cx9. Great price for it.
positive,Lexol leather care kit works great.  Its quick and easy and when your done the leather looks new.
positive,been using BG products for years with outstanding results and am delighted to find Motor Oil Additive (MOA) at this great price.
positive,"Outlast conventional OEM plugs: see NGK's website for change interval. First set (of plugs), lasted 80K miles and could have gone another 10K miles (minimally). Pricey, nevertheless, worth the labor of installing (conventional plugs) every 30K miles."
positive,"They look good, love the color"
positive,Great price great quality
negative,Not genuine
positive,My son loves it!  He can park his RV without help!  Happy I got it for him!
positive,Came in today cant wait to put it in my jeep.
negative,"Doesn't fit my windshield. It is too small and the visors won't hold it. The purchase screen mentioned nothing about sizes. I was led to believe that it was a universal size, but it is not."
negative,"terrible quality, not weather proof.<br />First time it rained the inside filled with condensation.  looks ridiculous"
positive,I love the pockets behind each month.  It helps me to keep track of coupons that may expire that month and other papers that I have to deal with before the month is over.  A great organizer!
positive,Sort of stiff ride. 2004 Tahoe.
positive,"Put on 2006 suzuki boulevard c50. Looks awesome. Right side installed very easy but left was a little more difficult. The left one has a torx bolt in bottom that needs to be removed to install new one, problem being the pipes get in the way of fitting the torx wrench in. I solved this by using a dremel and cutting the short side of torx wrench down by about half an inch."
negative,"I have two of these covers, for different vehicles. Unfortunately, they last one season before they begin to fall apart. The design is good, the material they use is inferior. I tried calling the company, but they essentially said ""too bad"". I would buy another if they used a better material."
positive,Excellent battery at a great price - arrived fully charged and ready to go. Perfect replacement for my original equipment heavy duty lantern battery.
negative,"False advertisement, no hardware"
positive,"These cup holders fit perfectly in my '05 Tacoma. When I bought the truck the factory center divider was missing, so I just had a big rectangle open area that really didn't secure drinks. These two cup holders fit perfectly in that space and will help to secure water bottles, coffee cups, etc. I'm very satisfied with this replacement product."
positive,Fit perfectly and great price
positive,These made a great set of replacement wiper blades for my jeep. They are very easy to install and work well. They are durable and sturdy and wipe rain dust and other particles off the window cleanly. These are affordable and even work better than the higher priced ones do. Great choice of you need replacement windshield wipers
negative,We purchased the scanner and were happy after the first usage. We tried scanning a second vehicle and the device was having issues connecting to the same device we used. The app would bug and say the device is not connected via Bluetooth. We emailed the company and received zero follow up.  We returned it after seeing other people had the issue that it suddenly quit working.
positive,This seems great.
positive,Thank you
positive,I got this for my husband to add to his 2018 JLU. This is going to be a game changer when it comes to additional places to keep your phone or anything else needed while driving. It seems sturdy and has decent adhesion sections.
positive,"This is a MUST HAVE for anyone who washes their car and doesn't want to take any chances of scratches by small particles.<br /><br />Does the job well, keeps dirt at the bottom of the bucket AND fits perfectly in a 5 gal orange homer bucket."
positive,"It's a solid product, and should last longer than I will..."
positive,"This is a great windshield, especially since it doesn't cost very much.  I do think you should have two people put this on your bike, so you don't scratch your bike when you are installing it.  Good value, and it cuts down on the wind nicely."
positive,[[VIDEOID:8aa1949d5edaa73e9392360d947afba2]] Large size<br />Flap for in doors<br />Elastic for around side mirrors<br />Reflective to absorb sun to melt ice/snow<br />Built in magnets for on the long piece that extends onto hood.<br /><br />Seems as well made as any with some nice features.<br />Trust you found this review honest and helpful:-)
negative,"Moog K series control arms are supposed to have a lifetime warranty, I purchased these Sep 2012 and installed Mar 2013... giving me about 18 months of use... the right (passenger side) upper ball joint is already knocking. through Amazon, I can no longer return this product... so I have to try to go straight to the manufacture if that is even possible"
positive,"just  started  using,,,,,time will tell"
negative,Sized like a child's seat.  Will only be stable on a very small bucket seat.  VERY SMALL  BUCKET SEAT<br />Took it for a spin in Kailua Kona 20 miles on January 11 and it did provide some ventilation but my 200 pound 6 foot frame was very wet beyond the center section  Temperature about 78 degrees No AC windows open.
positive,Works great! For my 2010 Volvo XC90. Just watch the youtube videos and remove the one tab thats impossible to get the screw in.
positive,I'm very pleased with my purchase<br />Great product especially for the price
positive,"In reading the technical specs of this mount it should have accommodated the iPhone 6 Plus, but there is a caveat to the 6.25&#34; vertical limit of the phone.  While you can technically squeeze a 6.25&#34; device into the holder (the maximum size listed by the manufacturer), to do so the side pieces have to be removed with the spring mounted holer is at its furthest distance making it an incredibly tight fit.  With all of the side pieces installed it is impossible to get the iPhone 6 Plus into the holder due to the curved supports.  I was ultimately able to remove the spring loaded portion and use pressure from the remaining supports to hold my phone both vertically and horizontally without the stop support installed at all.  I do find all of the supports on the front to protrude an excessive amount, but it does a good job of anchoring the phone."
positive,"nice wheels, but not the most durable finish."
positive,Likr
positive,Can't see any difference from the original!
negative,"First off I am not so sure you even need this for a Ford Triton, if you have deep-well same size it would work just as well. The tool does have a rubber grommet to hold the plug in place which would be the only benefit, however it is oversize and does not hold the plug very well.<br /><br />It is high quality, but once again I wound up using a deep well that I had in my box anyway. Only reason I gave it 3 stars was it is a quality tool, though not needed.<br /><br />I would pass on this."
negative,plastic butterfly
positive,I bought a timing chain kit. Product exactly what I needed. Great material.
positive,Good Product
positive,Appears to be quality sockets!
positive,Work great good quality piece
positive,"Works great,easy to install,and it got rid of the ""gascap"" light."
positive,"I have always had cheap chargers, so didn;t know what I was missing till I got this.  Charges very quickly.  So nice to come out and find an almost dead battery fully charged.  has gotten me out of two jams so far.  VERY happy with the purchase.  Don't do like I did - get something good for charging the FIRST time."
positive,Good pro
positive,These 3 pin plugs+sockets worked great for my RV. They seem sturdy enough. I will see how the hold up after a year or two.
negative,"Did not work, I am still getting a parking assist error !"
negative,It lights up. It’s not that easy to install though. It doesn’t stay put really it’s OK.
positive,Loves these but loctite those allen screws! Was running with a Porsche SUV and she went silent or started running through the muffler again. Two screws had fallen out and baffle shut. So loctite them and just weld her on and get it!
positive,"My original power adapter works well, but it was forgotten in a cabin.  This fits the bill and powers the device as the original one did.  The rest is basic ac/dc adapter stuff.  The adapter gets warm, but not unusually so.  The fridge stays nice and cool!  Not much else to say... It works."
negative,"After a week from being professionally installed, the remotes will not work anymore. Additionally, the only door to work now is the driver side. I do not recomend."
negative,"There is a flaw in the design. The neck is absolutely smooth so it is hard to create friction between remover and the bearing.<br />The only way I was able to use it, is when I roughed up the neck and the bearing with sandpaper and had to buy a driver. I tried to use it with the smooth screwdriver, but it did not work."
positive,Works great
negative,"They look pretty good. However, the pictures make it look like the background is flat black and it is not. It's a lumpy bumpy texture. And shiny, to boot.  I had hoped it would blend in better with my mailbox but it sticks out like a sore thumb. Check out the customer images, it shows it quite clearly. Too bad I didn't look at those first."
positive,Works great.
positive,to short
positive,"Lasts long, smells great. Con - A bit on the expensive side for an air freshener. 4 star only because of price."
positive,Works great
negative,This product doesn’t stick well to the car. We lost one on the first drive !
positive,Easy to bend and flare. I used it to re plumb the whole brake system on this Datsun 510. Will definitely buy more!
negative,This product does or works as advertised it just seems that needs to be a little thicker to fit or close the gaps when installed as instructed I had to double up in several areas to get a good seal on my Tellgate
positive,It circulated the air greatly and exceeded my expectations.
positive,Great kit that has everything needed for an oil change in your 4 stroke Mercury outboard. Best price found after extensive search. Delivered quickly to my door. I had the oil changed in about 1/2 hour. The yellow filter drip tool is a nice must have to prevent an oily mess.
positive,excellent products
positive,"OMG!!!! This stuff is a miracle, I am able to go 4-5 weeks without washing my car. And we have tons on pollen in my area."
positive,"I was skeptical this lower priced ($12.50) vinyl spare tire cover (28 inch) would be any good but we opened the box, threw the old tattered cover away and slapped this puppy on and bang, looks great, fits great and makes us happy. What more can you ask for?"
positive,"I used it to support my lower back in my car. I can feel the difference right away. Very comfortable. I don’t feel pain on my lower back anymore, while I’m driving. You must get it if you driving and have a lower back issue."
negative,"Worked fine and looked great , at first then one lens fogged up in less than 24 hrs and bulb also won't wotk on reg beam ( I imagine it shorted out from moisture)"
positive,Cool looking bracelets - you’d never know they had a second use for safety!  Didn’t break glass with these but they’re easy to put on and off and adjust.
positive,Fast delivery. Thanks!
positive,The paint-saving bottles are an excellent option for wall and trim touch-ups but I wish there was an option to purchase fewer bottles. I need only 4.
positive,They are amazing
positive,it real good
negative,"I've had these now for going on 2 years.  Within a month or two of owning them I could tell that they weren't nearly as sturdy as their competition, the Weathertech floor mats for my 2011 Ford Transit Connect.  I had looked at the Weathertech floor mats in several stores, as well as at the Ford dealer, and they were sturdy, fit perfectly with the contours of the van, but they were also $135.<br /><br />These Husky floor mats were advertised online as being sturdy and heavy duty, and designed for the EXACT shape of my van, and at only $90.  Husky has always made really great products, so I just figured it was a fantastic deal.  From the start, they never fit quite right.  The edges behind the throttle and brake were floppy, and the portion that goes up over the foot rest on the left bunches up oddly and make resting my foot there feel... strange.<br /><br />In the grand scheme of things, they are ok.  But honestly I would say they aren't up to the usual standards of Husky products.  They haven't torn, they haven't leaked, but the fitment could use work, as they do not look 'professional' once installed."
positive,"The shaft on the screws IS a bit short, most ikely because where these are made they don't use licence plate frames. Now the tip: l just got four of those and after reading the reviews here l figured l will drop a diamond or two, so...l used a small knife to try prying the stones, three out of four came out too easily. One of the four l could not dislodge. Granted at that price they all should be well anchored. However, they are really nice so if you care enough to use them forever, get some super glue and bond these suckers. After all, that's what dentists use to fasten false teeth on partials.<br />It took five minutes and the worry of finding a diamond gone (or two/three) is gone."
positive,As described
positive,I love that is warm in a cold weather. It is classy also.  Snug fit and now I can find my car easier..
positive,Fast delivery and works great
positive,Excellent product
positive,It locks together without need to melt/weld the halves together. GM dealer installed button replacements twice and they all failed within a few months.
positive,Great! Thanks!
negative,Limited help with this entry level tool.
positive,Perfect I love it
negative,"Now that I've gotten used to operating this, it's okay for inflating vehicle tires - and only vehicle tires. In order to program the desired pressure, the device works best when the pressure gauge is popped into the device and power is drawn from the vehicle or an outlet. I've found that the gauge is not sufficiently charged for programming steps unless plugged in. It's nice that it stores the desired psi, starts up again at the next tire, and shuts off when the desired pressure level is reached. If this style of pump meets your needs, I suggest choosing the option that comes with the wall plug.<br /><br />This is terrible for bicycle tires. I set the desired psi, connect the compressor to the tire by screwing, and inflate. All is fine until I try to remove the pump's tube from the tire. Without quick release, the disconnection process releases entirely too much air. I'm afraid I'll pop my tires if I intentionally over-inflate to account for what will be lost when I disconnect. My bike tires lost at least 6 psi when I disconnected.<br /><br />I have not yet tried to inflate sports balls with this. I plan to use my new bicycle tire pump for that task. I would not choose this air compressor again."
positive,"Car maintenance can be pricey, especially if your income goes down and your car gets older. As luck would have it (or not) – both of those things apply to me. As I can do some things for my car to save money, there are other things I cannot do.<br /><br />Replacing the headlight bulb is one of them.<br /><br />Despite my car being 11, almost 12, years old; the dealership where I take it is friendly and professional and works with me when it comes to maintenance. The last service adviser had me in stitches!<br /><br />But, they can’t control labor and part costs. This bulb and the labor would normally run me $65 to replace. Not feasible. Even the labor was too pricey.<br /><br />I still had this pack from when I had planned to replace the bulb last year; but, as (bad) luck would have it, I couldn’t afford to replace it. Enter my friendly (and funny) service adviser. I got this installed for $0 cost on the last oil change. And, I am VERY appreciative he worked that out for me. Since I had left it at home and had to come back, he joked it would take 48 minutes to install. That was a nod to my favorite NASCAR driver - #48 Jimmie Johnson. He liked another (retired) driver, who I incidentally met once, and liked as well.<br /><br />Anyway …<br /><br />As it turned out – the installation took around 30-45 minutes. I was out the door and on the way. Since I’m not an expert at installation, I can’t rate it personally, but the time I spent waiting wasn’t too long, so I’m happy with it.<br /><br />No negative comments about the bulb (and no recommendations for a better part) and no complaints about the install. I’m sure this is a fairly easy install for those well equipped to do it outside a dealership. The bulbs last a good long time, though my right sides go out more than the left (pretty sure it is a bad wire). This is the second replacement since I’ve had the car (got it new in 2008). The left side is still OEM. Three total bulbs in 11-12 years? I’m not going to be too upset.<br /><br />I’m fairly happy with these, and I still have a spare."
positive,Top Notch Motor Oil - Can Never Go Wrong With Mobil 1! Always Use The BEST! Super Fast Shipping! THANKS AMAZON! :)
positive,"Excellent, easy to install"
positive,"A little large for a Ford Escape, but it was originally bought for a sedan car, which it fit in better. Does the job well: blocking sun, and making people do a double-take!"
positive,Perfect size and super easy to fold
positive,Took me 2 minutes to put these on a 2014 Toyota 4runner.  I think this saved me more than $300.00 if I would have had the dealer do it.
negative,"Followed instructions provided. All the product did was turn the rust a dark grey color, did not remove any of the rust. Unfortunately, I was slow to come back to amazon to start the return process. You have 30 days to return the product & it has been 32 days so no return button was available. So disappointed."
positive,"So far I'm loving these little bulbs.  My OEM Interior lights in my 2002 Toyota Tundra, were dim and yellowed.  I really had a hard time seeing anything with them on in the cab at night.  These lights are a WORLD of difference.  WAY brighter than what I had!  They have a slight blue tinge but I'll take it over the darkness I had before.  NOTE:  In the tundra, the lights I replaced were ever so slightly longer than these lights, they still fit you just have to pay attention to how they fit.  Also, the polarity is set unlike a regular bulb, so if the light doesn't work, flip it 180 degrees and you will be good to go!"
positive,"I backed up into a Holly bush and caused some scratches along the side of my SUV,worked great 👍.<br />  Scratches gone."
positive,Love it. Use it regular.
positive,"My buddy had one of these in his motorcycle saddlebag.  He flatted out the hills, patched his tire while it was still on the bike, inflated it with this inflator and we took off down the road.  It takes a while to fill a tire, but it's a lot faster than waiting for help to come."
positive,Worked great on 12AWG wire connecting to a 20A waterproof circuit breaker.  I didn't like the fact that a positive connection was exposed on my circuit breaker for my solar charger.<br /><br />I added these to the lugs and they worked great.  Just remember to put them on the wire before adding your ring connector.
positive,works great
negative,I ended up just tearing them off from how much they slid and really didn’t do much! Hated these
positive,I don't know who invented them but they're genius.
positive,"OEM quality. Does not match the PX8 paint code, but it's close enough to get by until I get it painted."
negative,It's just meh... I'm not impressed. It is not as good as the 20 year old shammy I replaced. It's smaller and doesn't soak up nearly as much water.
positive,great
negative,these kept me more at ease when parking it overnight at a hotel. They lock is a little finicky but they are secure. I wish the lanyard was about 6 inches longer so it reached the handlebars a little easier. I have to stretch the wire
negative,Very disappointed in this car tag cover.  Material felt very cheap and one was dented.
positive,Restored the luster of the paint and removed the swirls.  It took a  car that I thought looked pretty good before and made it look like a million bucks!  Deep shine.
positive,Top quality.  Fast ship.
positive,Perfect fit and looks great!  Makes the top look like new!!
positive,"The build quality is surprisingly good on it. The only downsides that i have also seen people say is that the stand it self can rotate unless you take some vise grips and really tighten it down. Also the ""hydraulic that lets the bike down slowly only goes as far as the bike goes so you might have to push it down to bottom it out but nontheless it is still handy to have. Overall i'd recommend it for the price."
positive,Perfect replacement for the drivers side &#34;repeater&#34; lamp.<br />NOTE: There are two styles of this lamp- a &#34;marker&#34; lamp and a &#34;repeater&#34; lamp.<br /><br />The marker lamp is flat and has an orange lens. This is just a side marker.<br /><br />The repeater lamp is rounded so it protrudes from the fender- and has a clear lens. This is a &#34;blinker&#34; or turn signal lamp.<br /><br />Be sure you order the correct lamp!
positive,Works good the ligh is a great addition
positive,Fit my bumper perfect
negative,Did not fix problem
positive,Works great. May need longer lines if you are using for boat but Home Depot had 1/4 inch in stock which is close enough to 6mm to work.
positive,Good price and very bright
positive,Quiet and handles great!
positive,"I use K&N filters in every one of my vehicles.  Especially in older vehicles you get a noticeable increase in gas mileage and the ole butt dyno seems to feel a little increase in power.  The cotton lets your car breath better than paper or foam filters while still keeping the air clean.<br /><br />This was for my '02 S4 and helped out with a few MPG right off the bat with no other changes.<br /><br />They also save money on a long enough time line because you don't have to buy a lot of regular filters, you just clean this one occasionally."
positive,Really solid and positive brake feel and noticeably less fade.
negative,I would never buy these again. They do not fit the curvature of the body on my 10th gen Honda Civic. They were a bit difficult to apply with little stretch and ended up wrinkling all over. I only ended up applying the front two for now until I can buy a better set. Do not buy these.
positive,"I've always cleaned my leather furniture with a damp rag. It seemed to work just fine. But then I went after some stains on my truck's leather seats and bought a bottle of Trinova. The Trinova did an excellent job of removing those marks, so I tried it on the furniture. I'm embarrassed to say how much filth I removed. It is so much better than a damp rag, and I'm sold. I have a bottle come every six months on Amazon's subscribe and save."
positive,Not very bright for an LED bulb.<br />Factory bulb is actually brighter.<br />This product is more for looks than functionality.
positive,Appears to be good a few months in.  My quad sat for a month in freezing weather and had plenty of reserve to start it.
positive,Worked for Trailer view in Honda pilot . Not enough strudy when vehicle is moving . I night you see flickering in your eyes when there js vehicle behind you.
positive,"Great light, no yellowing"
positive,"Aluminum housing is strong. Buttons are recessed well and light up. Wiring is over a foot long and has 3 wires for each button. The housing is a little over-sized for 7/8"" bars.<br /><br />Negative - the led button lights are on all the time regardless of the button being activated. Potential battery drain."
negative,A bit too small.<br />The two guide arms did not fit my door panel.
positive,Did exactly what it was supposed to do and great price
negative,"Drill, drill, drill if you like. Not me. Returned after reading directions."
positive,Best price around for a quality made tire
positive,"This makes adding lights to vehicles so easy. Comes with everything you need switch, fuse,and relay. I'm very happy with purchase."
positive,This is the best for using to block the sun. It fold up like an umbrella which is great so it doesn’t get all stepped on like the traditional accordion ones.
positive,Perfect for tuning with my MicroSquirt
positive,Great quality. Exactly what I wanted.
positive,Good product. I have used a few of these with no issues. They are just a little louder when starting up your atv
positive,Looks great. Install was easy. Price was perfect. Love it
positive,Have been using it in my 9 year old Audi for many years without fail.
positive,"Works great easy to use , small enough to store easy no air come out when taking it off , I like it 👍👍"
positive,"This is great for small, cosmetic repairs on leather or vinyl. Not for large tears. My recliner has lots of small worn areas and minor tears. Looks so much better now!"
positive,"it is very serpentine. it turns and twists really well and my Jeep goes ,'vroom' as it's intended to go"
positive,Seems to have fixed my pesky engine light problem. Now I just have to fix the fuel relay recall. :)
positive,"The hardest part was trying to get the tire bead over the wheel without wrecking the tube. I mashed up the first one using tire spoons, but got it to work with the second tube by using bike tire levers. Much less pinching and no issues with the tube after that. Seems to be good quality."
positive,Fit perfectly on my 2015 Jeep Wrangler. I've had it on for a few months now and no leaks. It will make my next oil change clean and quick.
negative,Packaged well and the mirrors themselves aren’t all that bad. However the bracket that mounts to the Jeep rusted within 24 hours of being installed and look like they are already 10 years old.
positive,worked fine for what it is needed for. it is very expensive and expensive to have programed for just a key to start a car.
positive,good quality
positive,Just as described.  Motorcraft product. definitely not a knockoff.  About 1/2 the price the dealer wanted.<br />Zero issues.
positive,Really easy to assemble built pretty strong I did get the extension for it that adds alot more room. It sits on the top of my 2015 jeep patriot very nicely.
positive,Ok
positive,Worked as required. Solid material
positive,Product came as described and has been functioning flawlessly. Can’t beat the price for a quality product
positive,Nothing beats this stuff for getting grease off your hands.
positive,These are great for any tool box! Easy to read measurements!
positive,"It works well. Easy to attach to valve stem. Lock works well. I like the gauge, easy to see. Air bleeder is easy and predictable ."
negative,I tried to use it once and it broke. Returned it.
negative,"Not exactly a direct fit, this was a few inches shorter and smaller overall than the stock one. The bolted joint fit, the other side I had to clamp over the existing pipe. Not the prettiest, but should pass smog now."
positive,very good
positive,It appears to be solidly constructed for a long life.<br />Adds a  nice look to the tail of the Boxster.
positive,Great
positive,Using this on my BMW MC.  Great adapter for my GPS which uses a standard cigarette lighter type plug which the European bikes don't seem to come with.
positive,Love these seat covers
positive,Bought for my 16 year old . Looks great hanging can me hung multiple places .
positive,It's great and very cheap compared to all others
negative,"I thought this would have a very fine abrasive to buff out scratches, but this is basically just Armor All for clear plastic.<br />Leaves a wax-like coating that makes things a bit clearer, but not much and must be re-applied.<br />Might be good for appearance value if you're selling something and just want to spruce it up.  Otherwise, don't waste your money."
positive,Its a good product
positive,Like the color. Use for a Maverick XLT 2022.
negative,Hopefully AC Delco still has high standards despite being made in china
negative,First the good things. Great price and plenty of power.<br />Bad thing. When drive goes up to engage with the flywheel it goes up too far and binds up. Can probably take apart and put a extra washer on the shaft to keep drive from going too far up. I just took whole drive end off my old starter and put on the new one. That worked but there is a clunking noise when it first engages. Engine cranks fine and starts with no noise.
positive,"The original engine mount of my 92 vw golf broke so I started to look for the replacement. You could say it is an OEM replacement, perfect fit.<br />Until now it seems to be perfect, lets see how long it stays like that!"
positive,This unit works great. I'm connecting to an Android Lollipop phone running Torque App in order to check the cell voltages on a Toyota Prius and a Camry hybrid.
positive,"First  i'd like to say Today is July 2nd I gave it five stars  because it actually covered my whole bike from top to the ground ,  The material is just awesome ,  it's nice and thick and texture is nothing like the other four I purchased from different sellers who claimed the cover to be 100% waterproof,  so anyone who lives in Illinois knows we get lots of rain and today is Sunday the first day I just got the cover and it will be put through the test because we have storms coming,  so after the rain I'll give my review again but after speaking to customer service (Daniel) about the material they are the only ones who assured me that my bike will be dry and they offer a lifetime warranty  to where nobody else offered  that ,  so for now I am very pleased that it covered my whole bike completely I have a 91 Honda Goldwing with saddlebags and trunk and it went over that very easy all the way down to covering my exhaust with room to spare,  so again after this rain I will check to see if my bike is dry and if it is then I highly recommend this cover over anybody else who selling Motorcycle covers anywhere on the Internet or Amazon.<br />Followup: Today is July 17, 2017 and i have to say that i'm am soooooooooo very pleased that this cover is keeping my bike dry, and it covers my whole bike to the ground and a recap my bike is a 91 Goldwing with windshield and trunk w/saddle bags and i still have room under the cover, it has a strap underneath the cent of the cover to keep it from blowing off and has 2 small openings at the bottom of the front wheel so you can add a tie down there too, Bottom line is if your looking for a cover that really keeps your bike dry then this is the company you wanna do business with, and they offer life time warranty which no other company has offered and nor is their covers 100 percent water proof, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS COVER TO EVERYONE!!!!"
positive,needed to protect wiring and hoses from excess header heat
positive,Easy install on my jd rear tire
positive,Much brighter than the original bulbs. Finally feel like I can compete with everyone else driving around. The bulbs fit just like the original. Install was a breeze.
positive,Not as easy as i thought to install. It came with no instructions so i had to youtube it and it didnt even help much cause it depends on your car. A lot of drilling and taping to get this to work… but still looks nice! Wish the material didnt feel so cheap but the original emblem felt the same.
positive,I would have given them five stars if they would have sent me everything that was listed in the kit the first time. They shorted me a bunch of seals but did send them quickly. Other than that mistake I would purchase again
positive,Fits my Fiat 500 dash perfectly!
positive,"I love this product, because it keeps me informed of the psi in each tire, so that I know which one needs to be checked. Is helping get the most out of driving and keeping the gas/how many miles I drive comparable. My only beef is the alarm is so loud, when it goes off if I’m driving, startled me. I would buy this for friends and family that drive a lot, or great distances."
positive,A perfect gift for our Grandson to go with the drone that we gave him for his birthday.
positive,"great quality, great price!"
negative,ok
positive,"Perfect, great price and service"
positive,East to install and by changing Cowell grille eliminated water leak
negative,"If you are on the fence about if this will fit or not, get the next size up.  my measurements were just at the high end of what this could be used for and I wish I would have purchased the larger size because it is a tight fit and because of this, the elastic that holds it tight is going to stretch out quickly."
negative,"wrong color arrived, i deal with it, rear hub spokes break an almost kill me!! on 2nd ride!!! hell no stay away!!! for your lifes sake!!!  update.. refunded my $$ back after me contacting them 3 times....."
positive,"Looks nice, had to flip the rubber gasket to fit my tank."
positive,"Love the threaded end of the inflator. Though it takes a few seconds longer than the traditional type, it is actually better because it fits correctly and snugly and inflates the tires accurately."
negative,Blocked the airflow to the oil cooler. I wish I had never purchased.
negative,"As nice as these look, they do not exactly fit on stock JKU headlights. The ring itself is just shy of (literally .020in) being the perfect diameter. My solution was to take a dremel with a 120g sanding disk to the outer edge of my (stock) headlights in order to make these rings fit. I only did one pass around the headlights, which has these rings fitting very snugly. The mounting tabs are also slightly too wide for the cradle, however there was enough flex in the tabs that they still mounted securely with the provided replacement screws.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a direct replacement of factory chrome rings, look elsewhere unless you're willing to modify your lights a bit to make these fit.<br /><br />I will edit my review after 6 months or so to comment on durability."
positive,Perfect fit.
negative,UPDATE: AVOID THIS POS<br />it never fit snugly and not shockingly the rubber piece fell off at some point because now I'm just left with the screws still firmly in place but no cover. Don't waste your time with this piece of crap.<br /><br />This was an inexpensive fix to my melted trunk handle. But it doesn't really fit snugly on the RX350. The tool that comes with it is barely passable but got the job done.
positive,Exactly the toolkit needed to do any type brake caliper work - a must have
positive,Works really well leveling our pop up camper.  It has made setup really easy.
positive,"Didn't even bother trying to install myself, especially after my mechanic said he would not tackle it.  Found a local sound/alarm business that installed it for $150 - works great."
positive,Fit as expected and cheaper than going to the dealership.
negative,I got this to keep my car seats clean but the covers are ripping and don’t stay on the seats highly recommend getting something else not worth the hassle of haveing to constantly adjest the covers
positive,Put this on my 2016 F150 and have not noticed a difference in reception.  Easy to install and works great.  Holds up at the carwash just fine.
positive,My uncle jim always said you can't polish a turd. But then again he was a bastard. That being said this stuff works amazing and should have all five stars for sure.
positive,Attractive
positive,As advertised
positive,"We've been using a larger (3x5) case for our fob, and although that size is fine for me (I just slip it into my purse), it's a bit large for my husband to easily just slip into a pocket.<br /><br />Our Porsche fobs are shaped more long and narrow than most other fobs so finding a case that fits was difficult.  I purchased a smaller case in another design (flap opens on the long end), and our fobs did not fit.<br /><br />This design fits perfectly.<br /><br />The only alteration I made was to add a tether from the fob to the ring on the case, so the fob is connected to the case.<br /><br />Because of the length of the fob, it does need to be put in this case at an angle in order to allow the velcro to secure.  But. . . it does fit, it does protect (tested it), and it does slide very easily into a pant or jacket pocket.<br /><br />One thing to point out is that the larger size case of similar design had 2 pockets (only one is protected).  When just running to the store, if I didn't want to carry my purse with me, I'd sometimes just slip an ID and credit card in the case.  This new mini-case only has just one pocket and is too small to fit a c/card.<br /><br />To me, that's a negligible downside compared to the benefit of its much smaller size."
negative,"We had a heavy snow, and I was scraping my truck, and the thing bent in half like a pop can. Would not recommend."
positive,I really enjoy having these to avoid scratching my sunglasses my just setting them on my passenger seat or tossed in the cup holder. I ordered the pink gems and it is really cute.
positive,As described
positive,"I was thoroughly impressed with this set. The screws are well made and the caps look great. Also, didn't have any issues with the tool as others have stated. Got them plenty tight enough."
negative,"There were missing parts, no instructions. It's not high enough, unstable, and doesn't mention that you have to go under 5 miles. For how much it cost, it should have been better made."
positive,"Perfect! One little piece is not adhered as well as the rest but overall I'm sorry I waited so long to purchase. Great addition to my car, looks great too!"
positive,Well made easy to wear. Has logo in metal adjustable bracket. Even has the logo in the tag.
positive,"short review is they work but they don't get as hot as I'd like (and i'm in california).  The other negative is the left grip is VERY tight, I had to use a rubber mallet to wack them on, so needless to say they won't come off unless you cut them off the bar.<br /><br />the pluses are the controller is easy to use and visually see what setting you are on.  They heat up decently quick but disappointed in the heat settings, especially on maximum.  I've used heated grips in the past that were just the elements under the OEM grips and those were way warmer."
positive,It fits perfectly in my 01 Acura Integra
positive,Worked perfect
negative,"This works for now, but I will be replacing it. I do not like how the mounting clip is centered because it makes my visor mirror unusable. The plastic is not dark enough for driving in the sun and I do not believe it is polarized as the &#34;hd&#34; vision title alludes. Lastly, it does not extend below where the visor goes, it is actually shorter. I’m a small person so I put this on in a way so it will extend below the visor, but then I can’t use the yellow panel for night driving. I gave it 3 stars because it hasn’t broken after 10k miles of driving and it is better than nothing."
positive,"My new Ford F150 didn't have a place for my front plate so I selected this from Amazon.  It arrived fast, and it was installed in minutes.  Online I saw where some peoy reinforce with string so it wouldn't come off.  My snapped in place and felt secure.  So I didn't feel it needed to be reinforced."
positive,"My husband loved it and put it right on. Nice tight fit and good grip, comfortable"
positive,Fit perfectly. at first I thought i got the wrong part but I emailed them and they checked VIN and said it was right and it was. awesome service. Dosent come with chip but has space to put your old one and a cover for it
positive,Bought our retirement convertible and had to have the hats to go with the car!!!!!
positive,"I have two. One on wifey's 302 roller cam HOT ROD ranchero (In Betty Boop pink and lavender) Yuck. actually it looks quite nice!<br />I have another on my king-king 460 Big Block 429/460 Ford. It's bored .30&#34; over = 468 cubic inches.  The Stealth has great awesome power off idle all the way to 6,500 rpm's if that's how high you want to rev your engine. My 460 has a shorter stroke than the 'rod snaapper&#34; 454 Chev. and even though it's a 2 bolt mains it's fine and it's balanced, etc.<br />Like I said I like the Weiand stealth."
positive,these lights are awesome!!!!! easy to install and i love the way they look on my trike...they are bright and beautiful....
positive,Works great for my RV
negative,The remote wont hold the program. It will randomly stop working after a week or two or a few days. Very frustrating!
positive,"Insert this tool, attach your ratchet, and turn.  It is amazing what a fraction of a mm makes when working on strut mounts of this type.  Therein lies the issue.  The tool is made of harder metal, which is great for longevity.  However the strut mount is made out of aluminum (at least the BMW's is), and if you have to use it several times, the tool will gouge the aluminum.  This forces you to move the tool to a new spot.  Eventually you will run out of spots."
positive,Very durable and look good
positive,Great for removing bugs from the front bumper and grill.
negative,Of the pair we only got one to work. I am not sure why. We took it to a dealer and the same thing happened for them.
positive,"This has to be one of the better purchases I've made for my truck. We're using it on a 2015 F-150 and it fits exactly as it should without interfering with the rear camera wiring. We also have a Rhino spray on bed liner and that didn't interfere with the installation either.<br /><br />The ladder brace/hinge piece screws in and lies flat without being wobbly or vibrating going down the road - we used 6 bolts to attach it. The ladder itself folds flat and the strap holds it properly and is reasonably simple to adjust for the proper tension.<br /><br /> I've driven around with this on my truck for three weeks now over some really rough terrain - I just got back from Terlingua and Big Bend National Park in West Texas. We did some off roading to get to our cabin, including rock trails cut into the Christmas Mountains, gravel/river rock trails alongside the Rio Grande and straight desert trekking. This ladder just rode smooth without bouncing around, no excess vibrations or noise. It unfolds, kicks into place and is ready to use in seconds. Flip it back up, snap the straps and get moving. I love the easy access to unload hay bales at the horse barn, luggage and dog crates on trips and the bikes and gear out in West Texas.  I can't believe we didn't get this sooner!"
positive,Zymol makes quality everything but this is particularly the best leather treatment I have found.
positive,This is the poor mans sealer for foam latex special affects make-up. Helps creme foundation go on evenly.
positive,"These look so much better than the factory set. My factory set is 12 years old and had begun to wear down, causing a rattle. This fixed the problem and the hinges look amazing!"
positive,"This is just too cute but I do not use these Ganz car charms for my car, I take off the little chain they come with to hang in the car and put them on a necklace chain and have gotten so many compliments for the unique and cute necklaces I wear!! All the Ganz car charms are double sided and the backside of this dog charm is... the backside of a dog!! Paired with a pair of paw print earrings and suddenly, you have a themed set to wear!!"
negative,Purchased in July 2017.  Silicone bands broke 1 year late. Ball Joint mount broke in 14 months while riding on flat paved path. Phone went flying at 18 mph into high grass area off the path. Luckily was in Otter Box case that saved the phone. But spent 30 minutes looking for phone. Was able to find it using someone else's phone to call my phone buried in grass.
positive,Not bad
positive,Like how easy it is to slide in and out and this does not stick to my clothes...it doesn't shift around
positive,Great value for traditional wiper blade
positive,"I wear these things like they're going out of style, I'm ordering another pair for a new bike I have coming"
positive,Delivered as advertised. I am happy with it.
positive,"Fit, does the job, cheaper than OEM. I'm delighted."
positive,"Very pleased, easy to install and looks Great."
positive,Excellent spare
positive,"This was a good quality vinyl sticker . I love the print ,been on my car a few weeks now with no peeling , or sign of wear. Price was ok .Make sure to clean your glass with rubbing alchohal and leg dry ( it is fast ) before applying for best adhesion.A pin will let the air out of any bubbles that occur. I like it."
positive,Update: be sure to check if the exhaust pipe is fixable. A really rusted out pipe might need replacement. The tape will only work as long as the pipe holds up.<br /><br />This muffler tape did exactly what I was supposed to do. It was fairly simple to work with and I had my cracked muffler repaired in just a few minutes. The instructions were a little sparse and you should know that once you run the car for 20 minutes or so after the tables been applied it heats up and gets more solid. I wrapped mine with some simple twine has the instructions indicated and left that on there to essentially burn away. I’m not sure if that was the manufactures intention but it worked OK. Now are crappy minivan doesn’t sound quite as crappy.
positive,"I ended up returning it for a refund, on my TJ Wrangler, I prefer OEM parts, especially for electrical."
positive,Works just fine
positive,"Same as the red barons, might be to bright for some people,  fit and quality are good"
positive,"Well made. and does exactly what I wanted,... make a connection when the clearance is less than optimal. Tightens up well and no leakage. I purchased my first one of these, about a year ago from a retailer.  That purchase was to run water into a dog water bowl in a low clearance area next to a door. This one is being installed in much the same way but I am using it for a timed bowl cleaning accomplished via a sprinkler timer. Many videos on that from youtube."
negative,"It is pretty slippery when under your shoe, also it has a tendency to move around so really cinch it down. I think adding a little grip to the elastic both where your foot hits the ground and on top where it contacts above your toes would help. I'm thinking of using a hot glue gun to add a little traction to the bottom.<br /><br />Also I put this on a pair of redwings and the added bulk made it hard to get my foot under the shifter without catching the protector on the shifter."
positive,Had to order twice. Original order lost in shipping. Love the product though
positive,This is the last tach you will ever use.  I got this to tune a UTV with an aftermarket ignition and it has exceeded all my expectations.
positive,A very quality oil suitable for most any product
positive,Unit works great.<br />Plug and play.<br />I'm using it with the Torque Pro app on a 2005 BMW 325i.<br />Have not had any connection issues
positive,I was surprised this could be purchased without buying the whole ignition mechanism. Also snaps right into place with little issue!
positive,"These were perfect in updating the look of my car. Nice and snug without any need to worry about losing one. Make absolutely sure that you prep your rims (clean, remove rust, possibly pain if you can) the rim before applying them and you'll be fine."
positive,"Works fine so far.  Fenix makes excellent flashlights, too."
positive,A little nosier than O.E. but over all not bad. It did fit in without difficulty.
positive,"Easy to install, looks great and excellent price. Also fast shipping!"
positive,"It seems to work as advertised and seems to be relatively accurate, except directional flow of energy.  There is no way to tell which way the energy is flowing - in or out.  Other meters will show zero or a negative number when energy is flowing backward, such as charging.  This is VERY helpful to know if you are charging or discharging.  No way to tell with this meter, so I took off one star that.  I installed on an RV with Solar Panels, so it is important to know if I am exceeding my charge capability & drawing energy, or adding energy to the battery bank.  Can’t tell with this meter."
positive,I put it on my ATV looks great easy to place it .
positive,"I would caution anyone to not make use of the stabilizer thingy that goes into the tube. It isn't necessary and can restrict float movement and through you off in your measurements. That isn't a fault of the product, awkward to use in my opinion."
positive,"This windshield cover works great on our Subaru Outback. My husband works nights, so usually he has to scrape off lots of ice before leaving for home. The windshield cover blocks that, and protects the windshield wipers too. It only takes a few minutes to place or remove, and it fits nicely in the carry case. The magnets work well to keep the wind from pulling the cover up, and the cover is quite sturdy, good quality fabric."
positive,"My car was super dusty on the inside but been sick so been putting cleaning the car off, I got this and decided to give it a try and my dash is clean, it was so fast and I was done, looks great."
negative,"Not installed yet. If it works, I will write more."
positive,"As shown in the listing, this is a very complete 2 switch set.  All the mounting hardware is supplied.  There are even extra 3/8"" lugs, for a total of 8 lugs to use on the 4 terminals.  Nice that they provide these for the other ends of the cables attached to the switches.  They even provide shrink-tubing in both Red and Black (4 of each).<br /><br />Will be excellent for use in our RV's solar connections to the batteries.  Some switches I have seen are only rated up to 24 volts, which is marginal for solar arrays, but these are heavier duty and rated for up to 48 volts."
positive,Adjust has worked great it kept my seatbelt from cutting me across the front of my face over my nose from my forehead to my chin I'm now able to wear it to the side over my shoulder much better driving comfort
positive,I needed a fabric-type key ring for my motorcycle key and this fits the bill perfect! So glad I bought this :)
positive,"my old vehicle, may she rest in peace, finally had to go after 16 years.  Got a little SUV I can haul the heathen beagles around in.  I needed something that doesn't weigh a ton that will do light hair pick up AND clean the ashes out of the immovable ashtray.  Perfect."
positive,Really great way to save my battery due to a slow draw somewhere that I need to fix! Highly recommend!
negative,I should've listened to all the other reviewers. This helmet gives you major mushroom head. I looked like a kiddie driver at a go-kart track when I put it on.
