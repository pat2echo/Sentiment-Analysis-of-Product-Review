positive,Perfect fit...Really nice product!!
positive,"I have been making things frustrating forgetting to carry my sunglasses with me to and from the car. We have spots in the car to keep sunglasses, but they’re full these days and... so when I saw this case, decided to grab it. In general it’s a great, helpful item to have. But it’s not perfect.<br /><br />1. It arrives in a nice box, wrapped, and ready to go.<br />2. It’s easy to put in. There is the clip on the back - just slide it on.<br />3. It looks nice - a black faux leather kind of look and softer inside.<br />4. I tried a few different types and begins of sunglasses - some work, some do not. I can easily get the aviator style in, the ones with metal frames, but plastic frames that more wrap were all too big and did not fit. I tried pulling it further open, but was unable to get it to the point where they would go in well.<br />5. It sits on the outside or underside of the visor - on your side, not the roof side.<br />6. When the visor is up in front of you I do see it, but it’s not bothersome and within the first 10 or 15 minutes I forgot it was there and wasn’t “seeing it’ any longer.<br />7. When the visor is out - extended towards the window - it fits - in our Prius - fine, not holding the visor any lower than normal.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice holder and works fine. I do think one needs to consider 1. the kind of sunglasses and 2. how it’ll fit on the visor - 1. for protecting the glasses and 2. for safety in viewing. Beyond that, it seems well made and like it’ll last. I’m happy with this sunglasses case."
positive,So far so good
negative,"this is tough one. let me go over the good and the bad. then you can decide if it is right for you. these are exactly what they claim to be (which is not a compliment.<br /><br />Pro: they are what they say they are; one-time use, one size boot cover. they are water-proof as long as there are no holes in them.<br /><br />Con: they are thin and cheap, like every review says; about like a latex glove. they are costly. a box of 100 latex gloves is $9 and these are $7 for 1 pair. they are one size and that size is medium at best. they are very hard to get on over your shoes, again imagine putting on latex gloves that are too tight; it is a pain and can lead to tears. i took a pic to submit, but can not for this item. they are 11 inches long from heal to toe when laid flat.<br /><br />so, you don't walk on your hands when you wear latex gloves. there are not a couple a hundred pounds of pressure on latex gloves when you use them and you don't use latex gloves on the rough ground. see where i am going with this?<br /><br />so why 3 stars? they are what they are and if you need these them buy them. just know what to expect."
positive,Needed this.
negative,"Cinnamon,  love it!"
positive,Really nice but screw covers don't stay in place. This presented a problem with them falling out while driving. Good value for the product.
positive,"I bought this to blow out the A-coils in my HVAC air handler.  It worked perfectly, and blew out a ton of debris that was blocking the airflow in my HVAC system.<br /><br />After using this, the airflow at my registers in each room went from detectable at 12&#34; to detectable at well over 7' away!  My entire HVAC system usage also dropped about 20%.<br /><br />Totally great tool."
positive,"With the rainy weather upon us for the first time in years, I have found many uses for this grease on older cars that my friends have. It has helped with several tail light issues, where the trunk has been getting really wet. Love this stuff!"
positive,Thanks again....
positive,works as it should
negative,the cover is okay...the reason I gave it 2 stars was because the real strong smell of rubber that it omits is really strong and that rubber smell is left on your hands after driving.
positive,One of the Few plugs with Quality control you will get good continuity for tip to tip.
positive,Simply perfect. Very happy.
positive,Excellent!
positive,"Worked great nine my 2005 Ford Ranger, and the price was much less than local parts store."
positive,Purchased this product for both my sons. Good storage pouch and stays in place. They are happy with it.
positive,Never used but it looks like it'll work well enough when I do. I'll update if that changes.
negative,It doesn’t work
positive,Very handy!
positive,My husband had an old toolbox he kept bungie corded to a tie down on the side of the bed on his truck to keep it from rolling around.  I saw this and thought it was a little expensive but my husband has been so happu with it i feel it was money well spent and it definately is a lot cleNER LOOKING AND MUCH MORE FUNTIONAL.
positive,Perfect replacement for cracked reflector. I combined this with a uTube video and did the install myself. 🙂 Excellent overall experience.
positive,Fit our 2009 Springdale perfect very happy
positive,"This worked great on a 2003 Subaru Forester and a 2009 Mini Cooper S. I was able to read the trouble codes and reset the check engine light on both vehicles. I didn't even have to read the manual, as the menus were fairly self-explanatory."
positive,I installed this one on my Dodge Ram 1500 96 man this helped out a lot . Gained more power !
positive,Love the way this filter looks and sounds I got the cleaning spray with it too and it's easily cleanable
positive,Worked great.
positive,Nice
negative,I wish I Woukd have read the reviews before ordering. This DOES NOT fit a Chevy Malibu Maxx!! Sending back for a refund.
positive,works very well i like being ably to set it for the pressure  i need and then when it reaches it....  it stops no more guessing
positive,"This was a gift for my dad. All I can say is, my dad is very happy with this product."
positive,Life saver for traveling and needing adapter! Quality good
positive,"I like the price, and I like the feeling of safety that I have from keeping it in the glovebox. It is very lightweight, which concerns me a little--would it really work in an emergency situation? Hopefully I never get the opportunity to find out, but I will keep it in the car just in case!"
positive,"So glad I went with Corrosion-X and not WD-40, this stuff blows WD-40 out of the water. Did a great job taking the squeaks out of my door hinges as well as lubed old padlocks I had that were starting to stick due to water and rust!"
positive,I drive a 2017 fire raptor. They went in perfect. They are brighter than my factory ones.
positive,Best oil around
positive,Fits perfectly and was so easy to install!
negative,Xftyyuuhbb
positive,Works as advertised.
positive,These are for. Dodge Ram and the fit perfect!
positive,Very well made. Love the look
negative,didnt fit
positive,"This is my favorite hoodie! It is beautiful and the fabric is quality. A friend accidentally touched the sleeve with the hot ash of her cigarette... I was upset, til I noticed, it didnt leave a mark! Any other sweat jacket would have had a hole in it... I call it my ""armour"" now!"
positive,After reading the instructions and playing a bit . No problems installing an using . Works very well .
negative,"I bought 2 sets of these for my F150. They are bright with full coverage for a bright running and brake light.<br />But they don't last. Just had the 4th bulb out of 6 fail. they will start to lose diodes, flicker, and then fail completely.<br />Guess I'll be looking for a higher quality product.<br /><br />Update: Just had another burn out.<br />This means 5 out of 6 have failed in less than 5 months.<br />Wish I could give this a zero rating."
negative,"NOT GENUINE HONDA part, be aware connections are wrong, end of the tube are different from the original picture where is you have to put clamp... so trying to save some time looks else where!"
positive,Muy bueno para organizar los objetos dentro del carro.
negative,The size is not 6x12. 😕
positive,Fit in perfectly. Only issue is that my factory gas cap does not fit.
negative,Broke on the first try to connect and tighten the cable. Metal is weak. System is cloncky…
positive,"Worked perfectly on my pearl white, 2011 GMC Sierra Denali truck. Looks great! Works great! Highly recommended if you have a similar vehicle."
positive,"Fit my 2004 Honda Odyssey perfectly.  High-quality Bosch product.  Installed with the same Brake Pads.  Together, these products work flawlessly and are squeak-free!  Easy DIY to save hundreds of dollars!  My dealer quoted me $617 for front and rear pads and rotors (for some low quality brand too).  I bought all Bosch, front and back, pads and rotors, for $240!  Had them all installed in 3 hours!"
negative,I usually go for the off brand items but I made a huge mistake with this one... Only used it once! Didn't even make it to the trail..... I filled up with water to rinse and clean and attach the cap that is all it took to break the gasket and have water leaking all over the place thank God it wasn't fuel....tried using the spout and water leaked everywhere.... And to top it all off I had to pay for my own shipping for the return at half the price of the item.... DO NOT BUY!! TRUST ME BUY ROTOPAX LIKE I DID after purchasing this defective item. 12/16/2021 do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY!
positive,wash and scrub the bugs yes it does.  does the job like it says it will...
positive,I use mine to hold sewing pins. The magnetic pin holder I had before was chintzy at best so I upgraded. This is fantastic. I have knocked it on the floor several times and not lost a pin yet.
positive,It costs a fraction of the amount the oil change place wanted to charge and it’s so simple to change.
negative,"Very rigid and hard to install on steering wheel.  I have yet to get it on. Instructions state to warm it with a hair dryer. Last I checked,  there aren't sufficient plugs in a car to use a hair dryer. The purpose of the cover is to protect my hands from the cold steering wheel.  If I warm it in the house, it'll be cooled before I get it outside.  I'm in the northeast!"
negative,Horrible projection
positive,I purchased this kit to upgrade my lights on a 2015 GMC Terrain SLT. The product can packaged very well and secure and even had small zip ties and double sided stick pads to put the transformers out of the way (didn’t need to use either). They also came with cotton gloves to handle the lights which was a nice touch. The lights went in smoothly and worked well and the brightness and clarity is a huge upgrade over the factory halogens. Installation on this vehicle was a ridiculous pain but that’s GMC design and not Sealight. Definitely recommend this and will get for next car.
positive,"Rolled it on, looks great and it tough and durable"
positive,This product performs as required. A half thickness nut would be an improvement for a shifter ball.
positive,Worked great and came on time
positive,Installed a few weeks ago nd have taken the boat out in the water couple times . Looks good so far.
positive,Dislike  the Cost
negative,Bought two pairs for the coast. Ordered small for both 6 and 9 year olds.  They were both larger and loose on my kids. Both pants ripped at the seems between the legs from belly to back after 1 hour walking on the beach. Had to duck tape back together for the rest of our weekend trip. Didn't expect to last long at the price but hoped for at least 3 days use. They are light and water proof.
positive,Happy
positive,It fits perfectly and appears to be a very durable material.
positive,Worked great
positive,"It was hard finding a bucket fits well. Ive been Home depot and Lowes, but couldn’t find one. One was too big, but other one was too small dragging the organized skirt. However, when you find a perfect bucket for this, it would be worth it. I am very satisfy with this product."
negative,"Well made starter drive kit, but listed fit is baloney. Would not fit at all on my starter, which was in the list of fitments."
positive,Price VERY good!
negative,The thing doesn't stay tight. No matter what I did I have to tighten it after every drive... Till it gave up and the threads gave up... No good!
positive,The clips worked well. I wished there a few more of the smaller (narrower) size but all the clips seemed to be good quality for the price. I used them on a prius.
positive,It a good quality socket. It is definitely worth the money.
positive,"Shipping took awhile but I like it. My friend liked so much , I had to order him one too !"
positive,"I was so pleased when I received this holder and it fit my iPhone 8+!  Very, very easy to mount to the bike and to fit the phone in.  Just what I was looking for.  A low profile, flexible holder."
positive,"Good fluid, but price plus shipping was over 50% more than on the shelf at autoparts store."
positive,Bought this little bad boy to hold my Tennessee hitch cover in place. It has done its job perfectly!
positive,"Purchased this for a 2012 Silverado extended cab. The fact Chevy didn’t consider to be like dodge and make a factory recessed storage area still blows my mind. But none the less I got this to resolve that issue. Simple install of unbolting the factory spare tire tools setting your underseat box in and lining up the hole for the jack piece with your box putting your tolls on top and cranking it back down..<br /><br />Some said storage was small but honestly it’s your whole under backseat portion.. I fit all my tie down straps, spare container of oil, antifreeze, wd40, and still have 70% of the storage empty for adding jumper cable and so on..<br /><br />I think the price is well worth the item and would buy it again no questions looks factory works great"
negative,"Dangerous product.<br />Do not use on car windows or on any surface where visibility is safety critical.<br /><br />No matter how much or little I apply and how much I wipe and buff, this product produces a very bright rainbow-colored mirror-like glare. It also allows the window to fog up easier somehow.<br />When I first got the product, I applied it on the windshield, rearview, and side mirrors of my car. I buffed it out and it looked very clean. When I went driving the next day at night, every headlight that shined on the surfaces reflected all of the light back at my eyes and I could not see a thing on those surfaces besides white and rainbow. Before the drive, I noticed a lot of fog on the applied glass surfaces and didn't think much of it, but then I started noticing it every day (morning and night) and it would constantly fog up after I wiped.<br />I tried applying more than once with different methods after that experience. Still same results.<br />The product is incredibly hard to wipe off when you want to get it off."
positive,Not all aftermarket items are worthwhile. This adds a very nice look to my new F450 Superduty. Very smooth finish and factory appearance. Lots of compliments. Highly recommend this product.
positive,Looks great<br />Unfortunately large was to big for my hands.
negative,"Returned.  Even though answered questions said two, only one was in the package."
positive,Easy to install good directions and super white and bright. Turns the night into day.
positive,"Extremely good price versus the dealer. My symptoms initially was a frequent motor sound from under the dash, then eventually it went full hot or full cold, but if I smacked the motor it would work (just worn out) Once I figured out how the change it, it only took me a few minutes to install. Works perfectly and everything is COOL again."
positive,"These flashers are safe, bright and better than the old flaming flares.  They come in a nice case.  Every car should have at least one."
positive,Perfect for the garage! We used these in the garage and they work great! Wish they came a little longer as we sometimes vary our parking stance in the garage.  Buy two per door you need.
positive,"Perfect fit on my 2004 Nissan Frontier, I needed to find out why my truck was loosing spark and quit running while driving. This coil made the truck run alot better but didn't fix my problem.  I had to replace the distributor as a whole.Spending less than $15 was well worth it to find the real problem.  I would buy it again.....Only bad is that it took 10 days to get here by fed-ex"
positive,Exact fit and came with new nuts and bolts.  Fast/safe delivery and ready to go out of the box.
positive,"I have better luck with it by removing the leaking tire and wheel, breaking breaking just one bead and pouring it in and re-inflating the tire as quickly as possible then rolling it around slowly, even flipping the entire wheel over a few times so it can coat the tire and wheel inside, then put it back on and driving it around for about 10 minutes. Yes this even works if the wheel has micro-fractures in the casting but not if it actually cracked."
positive,It fits and protects.
positive,"Wasn't too sure at first. Bought it to ride mountainbiking when I want to look cute. Turned out OK. If you sweat a lot and get a smell, make a spray bottle of water and a few drops of tea tree oil and spray it on the armpits before washing. This works with yoga pants, too."
positive,I am very pleased with the fuel pump that I purchased. It looks very well built<br />and on my 1999 GMC c3500 it produces 54 pounds of pressure at idle. My old fuel<br />pump only put out 45 lbs of pressure. It was well packaged and it fit right in without any<br />changes. The seller followed up to make sure I was satisfied with the purchase and that<br />the product worked. I would easily purchase another one if needed from this seller.
positive,Comfortable too! Cool design my boy loved it!<br />Make sure the screws are tight for the visor though. I didn't think of it and we lost one. No problem though. They sent us replacement set at no charges. Great buy!
negative,DOES NOT HONOR WARRANTY!!!!!!! I’ve now made multiple attempt to warranty my shocks bought less than a year ago and they won’t even respond
negative,not worth it
positive,"Not sure why I had such a hard time installing, but once it was installed, it's a great product!"
negative,It said glitter like. There's nothing about this plain plate that glitters. Advertisement is misleading!
negative,"While it was easy to install, I had to cut off strings and sew a couple places where the faux wool was not attached to the elastic."
positive,This works great. It has charged and re-charged many batteries for us. Easy to use.
positive,Fits perfect on 1997 Miata.  Other caps were too tall and did not allow the fuel cover to close properly.
positive,This is my third plastic chrome hitch receiver. You may find that it fits a bit loose so wrap a couple turns of black electrical tape around the inserted end (as needed) and it will fit more snugly. After a year  the chrome will start to wear away on the face but these are cheap enough to replace more often. Buy two and have a spare ready!
positive,Fits perfect in my 2018 Camry.  Might buy another for the truck.
negative,"This is a nice item and is easy to hide on your motorcycle. It is very loud if you are on top of it or in a quiet parking lot. But I'm afraid that only the person taking the parts off your motorcycle will hear it if there is a highway near by.<br />**Unless you put it under something, when they hear the first small warning sound. They will smash it and it will never alarm.<br />Otherwise it is just something to make you feel cool as you walk away from it as it beeps."
positive,We have a refrigerator in a newly built garage space that has a 4” concrete curb at base of interior wall. This perfectly protects the fridge door from any damage when it gets opened against the concrete surface. Very easy to install; cut with a serrated knife to fit. Good solution!
positive,"Delivery was quick and the gauge is very well designed and made.  Have not had much opportunity to use it yet, however, so cannot really rate performance yet.  JACO followed up quickly to see if I was satisfied."
positive,WORKED AS EXPECTED
positive,save me a great deal of headache during ac line disconnects
negative,Got lights on of shipping box a tab was broken off. Wasn’t happy with it but husband was able to make it work for now. Tired of spending money for product and not entacted as described. Better packaging and final inspection might have helped. Not sure if I purchase again.
positive,Love this item makes my trunk look way nicer and keeps dirt and spills away from the carpet Just wish the sticky parts sticked better But overall satisfied
positive,Works as expected
positive,Perfect fit for my Honda Fit. Easy to install. I will buy this again.
positive,"Once a month, a 'green' cleaning service team comes in to do my house. It's owned by an ex-Marine who personally trains the employees. I originally hired them because they also do free house cleaning for Veterans in need (gotta love a company with a heart), and they don't use harmful chemicals.<br />I'm not good at cleaning and use too many paper towels.<br />There, I said it. Guilty as charged.<br /><br />I noticed that my cleaning service comes in with a stack of neatly folded, brightly colored cloths, and leaves with a bucket filled with grungy ones. Not one paper towel. No cut-up old t-shirts, towels, or rags.<br />So I asked what they were.<br />Microfiber.<br />So I tried these.<br /><br />When dusting, my usual cotton rag absorbed so much furniture polish it was ridiculous. With these, sometimes I don't even need the polish, they are like dirt magnets.<br />Then the ultimate test. The boat.<br />As much as I insist guests wear deck shoes, someone always boards with regular shoes, leaving black scuffs everywhere but below deck.<br />These eat up the scuffs leaving the white upper deck gleaming.<br />Next, my motorcycle. Gentle enough for the tank, tough enough for the pipes.<br /><br />I love that these are thin, because they get into nooks and crannies, and dry quickly, unlike thick towels.<br /><br />If these were any better, they'd do the cleaning themselves."
positive,Have not had to use it yet - but it has what I was looking for
positive,"Wow, wasn't expecting the battery to be delivered so fast.  Very well packaged.  I took the battery down cellar and put it on charge but it was fully charged.  This is going in my Champion Power Generator.  Will check it out on that in a few days and if I don't reply back it's because I'm very satisfied with it."
positive,I returned this magneto as I discovered my engine  had other problems that a different magneto wouldn't have solved.
positive,These fit in our cup holders and work well
positive,Good Honda part
negative,I placed them in my truck I used alcohol to wipe down the aira after dryed. I peld off the red strip and placed them up. Then I put a little package of kleenex in them the next day I got in my truck they where on the floor. Both of them So I don't think they are worth buying. Until they get better. But until they in prove the adhesion.
positive,Just as described. Looks great and work great keeping the wind of of your eyes!
negative,"These caps are nicely made, but are much too big for my Honda Civic's type 51 battery's cables and connectors. The material they're made from is very flexible, so the caps are easily pushed off the battery posts when working under the hood. They're a very loose fit. I'll contact Fastronix to find out if they overs with a snugger fit. (Note: I had to slice the tubular part in order to get the cap onto the cable without taking the original connector off. I then wrapped red electrician's tape snugly around the tube. They fit nicely, but the body of the cap is much too large for the battery connectors.) I bought these Fastronix caps after I tried to buy the original Honda equipment semi-rigid battery cap from my dealer's parts department. They told me it was only available with a battery!"
positive,"Installed this on my Toyota Prius 2007, and it replaced my 200k mile oem ones which to say the least, were completely shot. They worked great, and fit well. Will update review if I ever change them out or if they fail."
positive,Super comfortable and snug fit.
positive,Fits perfectly and appears to be of the same construction as the OEM filter in my 2013 Mercedes Benz C250 AMG Sport.
negative,"These wipes leave a greasy film all over! I made the mistake of using them all over the inside of my brand new car without testing an area first and I was left with a gross, greasy film on every area I wiped. It looked gross and dirty and dried with greasy streaks"
positive,"Didn't fit,  but made some adjustments to make it work.  Otherwise I really like it.  PLEASE read before you purchase this product to see if it really fits your Jeep soft top..."
positive,I had to do some trimming with scissors but it wasn't difficult abd I am a grandma
positive,"We loved the ease of having this on top of our Hyundai Tucson. We drove through multiple winter storms with blizzards, gale force winds, and driving rains. This held. We had suitcases and other random small objects shoved into this and it held the entire 1600 miles."
positive,"Zero leaking after 6 months, makes changing oil so much easier. No more looking for the right wrench, etc."
positive,Perfect replacement for 2011 Silverado 1500 LT
positive,"[[VIDEOID:7040c74bdc1d046de92273562faaafcd]] The gaskets are about 10""x8.5"", each one is slightly different for some reason. The gaskets in the set are 1/8"" & 1/16"" in Rubber infused cork, 3/64"" rubber cellulose (blue), & 1/32"" rubber fiber. The rubber cellulose (blue) is rated for water & coolant, the others are rated for water, gasoline & oil. There is a handy spec sheet included in the pack which has this information & more that would have been very helpful in the actual Amazon description.<br />I have several gaskets to make for a motorcycle engine so I ordered this multi-pack of gasket material not knowing exactly what thickness & materials I would need. I have only used the 3/64"" rubber cellulose so far to make a water pump gasket. I haven't tested it with water under pressure yet but I think it made a nice gasket.<br />The blue rubber cellulose was hard to cut by breaking it over a sharp edge. It cuts pretty well with a sharp razor blade but it also dulls the blades pretty quickly."
positive,Exact fit and work great.
positive,Arrived on time but is slightly thinner than the one it is replacing that was damaged in a rear-ender
positive,I keep a pair of sunglasses and readers on these. Works well for holding papers and parking slips too
positive,The quality of the cover is good nice hard surface durable and keeps stuff dry in the bed of the truck the directions are terrible and are very vague difficult to install by myself but I was able to do it after about 2 hours of trial and error
positive,"Always use when I change spark plugs, never had an issue."
positive,"Good price, and I prefer satin finish over the glaring shine.. reminds me of 303 aero without the higher cost. Will buy again"
positive,This is a must have if you own a vehicle with a sealed coolant system.  I had trouble with air pockets in my Mini Cooper before I had this.  It was a pain to bleed the air out of the system.  Now that I have this you just create the vacuum and fill straight from the bottles.  Takes a matter of minutes instead of an hour.  I would happily pay more and this will work for year to come.
positive,this is a well made connector with excellent instructions for terminating a 10 ga. cable
positive,pretty good  mud flaps great price ease of install
positive,My goto when I need a coarse rubbing compound
positive,Good value. Silicone case is a little flimsy.
positive,"Perfect for your home DIY science projects!<br />My son needed to complete an end-of-year science project involving 9v batteries. We needed an easy way to power project using battery and alligator clips. The battery clip was simple, and it's two lead wires were perfect for the job."
positive,"It's been only about a month, so I can't comment on their longevity. But I replaced the burned-out tiny incandescent bulbs in our house number sign, and they look great. They are slightly brighter than the old bulbs, and a much bluer (&#34;whiter&#34;) light, compared to the yellow light of the incandescent bulbs. Fast shipping and a very reasonable price. If these last as long as the incandescents, it will be great."
positive,Fit my 2017<br />Camaro perfectly! Easy to put on in a few minutes! Very substantial material.  Excellent purchase!
negative,I wasn't really pleased with this replacement as it didn't solve the problem. I went through the process of going to a dealership and getting it re-programmed. It seemed to work but then a day or so later it was lagging/not reading like the original.<br />I went back to the dealer and they re-programmed the original.<br />Not great.
positive,"Great Value for the money! We packed this thing to the point we were nervous it was going to bust. It did NOT. We took a 7 hour roadtrip roundtrip, got back, hosed it off (bugs) folded it up and put it back in its nifty little bag. We only have roof bars going the length of the car and it stayed in place on its non skid mat that came with it with no problem at all."
positive,Kept gas in 55 gal. drums for three years. Use as directed and can't go wrong.
negative,"I love this sticker, the color and size is as described and it looks great on my jeep. The only reason I can't give five stars is ihat it started to peel off after only one week, even thoughgthe window was cleaned etc before application."
positive,"* update to the update, Hikari sent an updated version of the bulbs which work as designed and clip in and connect as they should. Happy with the outcome, just sorry it took all of this to get there<br /><br />*update....Hikari contacted me and replaced the headlights with a newer model that should click together and work as designed. We shall see....they should arrive today!<br /><br />The headlights themselves are good, the companies customer service....not so much. I had a problem with the particular bulb not clicking in as designed. Wrote to customer service with a few questions and they will not answer a question for anything. So if you order these lights, just pray you don't ever need any help or have any questions pertaining to their product, because they will be of no help. You would get more answers out of a houseplant or your dog"
negative,Doesn't cling to anything
positive,"First of all, I love that I don't have to figure out battery type and size.  I worry about my wife being stranded alone.  Having this, to keep in the car at all times, eases my mind a little.<br />Has a nice digital screen to make seeing it a lot easier than the one I used to use.<br />I like the cord and cable wrap.<br />I really don't know anything about car engines but, I like that it also checks the alternator.  For a mechanic that's a wonderful tool.  For a non mechanic like me, at least I'd know that something else is wrong and maybe not just my battery.<br /><br />Hopefully I won't have to use this too often but, it's good to know that my wife will have a little comfort when she's on the road by herself.  It only weighs about 7 lbs and small enough for her to handle by herself.  Also will alert her if she hooks the cables on wrong.  Love that feature!"
positive,Bullet Proof
positive,"Thick, folds nice"
positive,For my 8BA Ford Flathead! Works great.
positive,"This looks perfect on my 2008 Camry Solara steering wheel. The carbon fiber print and grey padding matches the aesthetic and really enhances the look of my interior, while also making the wheel thicker and easier to grab. I tried a couple of other steering wheel covers before this and didn't love them for one reason or another. This is the perfect feel and texture and aesthetic, I can't imagine my car without it anymore. It feels like this is how it should have come from the factory."
positive,Fit on my 1966 mustang with a 351W
positive,"I've been using Mobil 1 for decades now. This is my go-to oil to keep all my vehicles lubricated. Rather than run that fine oil through some cheap filter I lean toward the more expensive ones thinking that more cost equates with a better filter.<br />All that said, I trust the Mobile 1 brand.<br />A friend of mine owns one of those quick change oil businesses. He collected a bunch of filters and sawed them in half. There is an enormous difference in the construction and therefore the oil filtering ability of an oil filter. Cheap really did equal to a cheaper made filter. Expensive generally equated to a better constructed filter.<br />Researching through the internet lead me to the same conclusion that looking at a bunch of sawed through filters.<br />This filter stood out for construction, and oil filtering ability."
positive,No complaints. Item worked fine with our vehicle. Folds down easily and love the pouch that came with it.
positive,Looks good changes things up. Gives you that custom feel along with the other 5 million who purchased this for their rides in the past.
positive,Great tool to diagnose problem and offer top fixes.
positive,They work
positive,Pricy but. Ad to the bone! Looks great
negative,"I like this organizer. Bought it for our truck, but not big enough. I kept it because it is still helpful. Each compartment held about 2 groceriy bags full of food. Didn't bring ice, so can't comment on that. I will keep and still use it and may even buy another, just wish a larger size available."
positive,One of the easiest upgrades I've done!
positive,"It works fine, large numbers."
positive,"I had put amber lights in my rear interior domes to match the amber ambient lighting in my Mercedes GLA, but the amber was too orange for me.  So, I ordered these because I am looking for what I would describe as ""golden yellow"".  There's nothing ""gold"" about this yellow.  They are so yellow that they're almost green---a very cold yellow with no golden tones whatsoever.  Picture looking at a bright yellow light through a glass of mountain dew.  It's VERY BRIGHT yellow with definite hues of ""electric green"".  I'll keep looking.  But, I can say these are VERY bright, seem to be very well made, and so if you're looking for a yellow that reminds you of Mountain Dew, these are going to make you very happy!"
negative,"Bought this kit. First off, it didn't come with the bolt covers (little black plastic things) shown in the photo. Second, it comes with too few secondary parts for the primaries (not enough nuts & washers). Because of that second thing, I wound up using the plastic nuts, and those don't stay on. Not worth it."
positive,Good fit looks factory
positive,Easy install no problems yet
negative,Would not work with my truck windows that apparently have some sort of safety sensor where it will stop the window if it senses an obstruction. I never could adjust the fit to allow me to use my window without disabling that safety feature.
positive,"good fit like OEM but the bolts supplied did not work too short and incorrect size, had to reuse the stock factory bolts"
positive,"The goggles DO fit over my glasses.  They DO darken &#34;a little&#34;.  (the photo is a little mis-leading) It's not so dark that you really get &#34;shade/sunglasses&#34; level protection, but it's better than nothing and it allows me to look a bit less geeky with the protection my glasses need and a bit of shade in sun or clear at night."
negative,"Comments that I read before I bought this tour pack prepared me for the issue that the supplied hardware was completely useless, and trust me, it is.  After designing new attachment system, and spending some time at a specialty hardware store, I have a rock solid fully detachable tour pack that works well. You also have to put additional gasket material around the bottom of the lid to make it fit more snugly as well. Without that it will rattle your brains out. Overall, it was really easy to work with and modify, and looks OEM enough to fool most people. What works best is that it is super spacious, and that's a huge plus."
positive,Worked great on our van windows.  Kept the sun out.
negative,It’s alright… it’s works as it is. Just don’t think the quality is as it’s best. For what it is it’s ok.
positive,very nice and well made and excellent fit 2014 accord
positive,My husband used it on his 2006 Jeep Liber\ty and found the problem he was having with the gas cap on this vehicle.
positive,"The sleek new retro color scheme is exhilarating... Just kidding.<br />These offer the best quality for the money in oil filters.<br />Glad to see these on Amazon, now that Walmart stopped carrying them."
positive,Used for my 2002 Toyota Corolla. Covers my blind spots very well. Only problem is that I can't put down my window sun blockers or else they'd push the mirror.
positive,This is truly an amazing product. It literally transformed the windows of my 2002 Honda Odyssey. I rarely write reviews and certainly not given to hyperbole. I am very impressed.
positive,As advertised
positive,"Fits good on our suv , easy to install, breathable fabric so can easy drive with the window open. Keeps insects out."
positive,Delivered quickly and exactly as advertised
negative,This cord will not work without the correct programs.
negative,"very low price, equally low quality."
positive,Works very well.  VW redesigned the fan so the fan motor is more protected from dust and dirt than the original fan that came with the car.
negative,"I do not care what anyone says, putting fittings on these hoses is a major chore.  I tried heating the hose in hot water, using a little white grease...nothing helped to make it easier.  After about 20 minutes of struggling I got fittings onto the hose.  I was using Camco fittings.  I highly recommend just buying the hoses with fittings attached."
positive,A bit tricky to install in my 2016 Legacy. But there are a couple of videos on YouTube which were helpful for me. Product itself appears to be of good quality and has served me well in the past.  Cost compared to the dealership can't be beat.
positive,Replaced this boy my boyfriend's truck. He loves it!
positive,"I've used Beck Arnley pads several times for Nissan vehicles. They always seem to perform as good as OEM pads and are of a decent quality. Quiet, smooth, and as long lasting as the OEM Nissan pads. Decent shims and are painted with a hard, long lasting enamel that keeps them from rusting between the shims and pad backing."
positive,I have been using this for years and it never disappoints.
positive,"This antenna replaced an old stubby antenna that someone stole off my truck, and it worked like a charm.  It was a snap to install and it works great, even getting stations that my old antenna didn't and music sounds clearer too. less static.  Not as low-profile as the stubby, but still looks good."
positive,Great
positive,Perfect all round tire for the Porsche Cayenne
positive,"Way cheaper than mopar, looks OEM, no issues! just remember to keep the wiring harness from the old one! I am an expert with these  vans and I don't mind these at all. Faster and cheaper than OEM. No quality issues so far."
positive,Very good product.
positive,"Very cool gift idea.Easy to locate,order,fast delivery.Satisfied!"
positive,"I practically live in a vehicle.  I not only take my dog on mini road trips, I also drive a bus and a minivan for a senior living center.  I can barely eat without a steering wheel in front of me, so this tray is fantastic.  I can spread out my lunch without trying to balance it on the center console and have to eat sitting side saddle.  I also have to wait for my passengers sometimes and now I have a great way of playing on my phone or tablet or doing minor paperwork.  This is a great product which is strong and should hold up for many, many years.  It fits beautifully on my Chevy Silverado truck, but is a bit iffy on my Fiat’s steering wheel.  The steering wheels on the company Dodge Minivan and our Chevy Converted handicapped equipped bus are also able to hold this tray.  Three out of four isn’t bad."
positive,I could not build it for this price and I am a welder  well made
positive,I really like the stuff Dorman puts out.  The part itself only took about 30 minutes to install and was very nice quality.  Taking off the door panel takes some time and should be done carefully don't ruin the cover!  The motor is a little louder than stock but not much at all.  Everything looked prefect right out of the box and the hardest part is getting the regulator in the door through the hole but sure enough it will fit.<br /><br />Overall this is a very very very easy thing to replace on your window.  DIY and save a lot of money.
positive,"Well made, nice finish. I had a set of these on another car that lasted seven years without pitting, rusting or dulling. Overall, a quality product that provides a nice finish to the vehicle."
positive,I like they don't move around. Look brand new
positive,I like how it easily attaches and does not leak!  The locking ring is positive giving a good solid feel.
positive,Great Toyota quality replaced grommet while replacing my PCV Valve on my 2001 Camry have a great day everyone
positive,good protection
positive,"super fast shipping, perfect fit  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!"
positive,"This is one of those things that you can save a bundle on doing yourself compared to the dealership, and it's literally a 2 minute job. Hardest part is locating where your filter is in your cabin - usually somewhere under or around your glove compartment. Then it's simply a matter of undoing a couple of plastic screws, dropping the old one out and sticking the new one in. You'll want a handvac handy to take care of any debris from the used filter."
positive,This tool does easily reach the inner windshield where it's hard to reach to clean.
positive,Works well..does the job right
positive,The clutch works perfect but it would not work in my application
positive,It works great but I should have bought one that works with my smart phone.
positive,"Nice sticker, hope it lasts long"
positive,"Only had this headlight for a few weeks but I'm impressed so far. Easy installation, it took maybe 10 minutes. Haven't noticed much difference between Hugh beam and low beam with the low beam being so bright. This is much brighter than the factory headlight. I'd recommend it to anyone needing to replace or upgrade"
positive,"it umm locks threads, I wish they would put the temps and such on the bottle so i can throw away the packages"
positive,"Great fit, same quality as OEM and for a fraction of the cost.  Instead of buying a golf cart tune up<br />Kit I was able to source all the parts for the kit for a 1/4 of the price."
negative,"Never believe the ""universal fit"" propaganda. I have one for my Ford Explorer and it fits most of the windshield. There is a two inch gap on each side of the umbrella.<br /><br />I also bought one for my wife's car, a Mazda 6. It broke the first time she opened it."
positive,quickly and easily cleaned up my towbar
positive,Holds phone very tight and doesn.t move around
positive,Made the gille pop!
positive,Works great! Gets in all the crevices in the car!
positive,"It's been 9 months and 4,000 miles since I installed it and no issues.(I don't drive that much) sure hope it lasts for years."
positive,"Item delivered as described, would/will to business with seller again."
positive,I’ve purchase 3 of these already. One for me and the others for friends and family.
positive,"I put this cleaner in everything l have with internal combustion, including my mower. I would say that unless anyone is totally mechanically inept, the difference after a reasonable running time with this cleaner is not to be believed. The cost is more than offset by the gain in fuel consumption, smoothness and power output. My wife's Prius after four yesrs of on board computerized 44mpg jumped to 47 after the first tank with this cleaner...unreal!"
negative,"at first glance they looked great, installed just fine. Rechecked torque after heatcycles. No problems.<br /><br />First year, no issues. No backing out. All great.<br /><br />Now while racing my car one of the heads of one bolts decided to pop off.<br />After many a drill bit and lots of fun I managed to get it out...what a nightmare.<br /><br />Steel was good, casting was not. Examining the break you can see how cheap it is...<br /><br />used to love mr.gasket..."
positive,"exact fit, albeit tight, for Dodge Ram 1500 with 4.7 ltr engine"
positive,Worked great in the camper but need to make sure we have the water conditioner hooked up!! Debris in the water clogged up the nozzles and need to use CLR to clear the debris!!
positive,Works on all airlines. If you need a seat belt extender these are the deal. Great product and has safety notice so its the real deal. Good value for your money.
positive,Can't go wrong. It really fills up fast. Easy to use. Cheap. I recommend
positive,"Plastic retaining clip broke on all of my 2007 Lexus ES350 coil plugs. Replaced all of them with these plugs, less the wiring. There is a video on YouTube showing how to change them over, was easy and very helpful. Great product."
negative,"Matt arrived rolled up in a tube like box.  It has been over a year now and it has never taken proper shape. Yes, I let it sit in the sun.  Not what I expected from weather tech for this price.  Recently saw a friends weather tech purchase, same cargo matt and it is perfect.  Very disappointed.  Please see pictures after a year installed.  This is better than day 1, but not acceptable for price."
positive,Very easy to use. Faster to use than foldable sun shades.  As well as better coverage of windshield and easier to store.  All around great product.
positive,Worked well in my 63’ Chevy C30. Glad to get the old generator out of there that weighed 3x as much as this alternator.
positive,"I drive a 2010 VW GTI, and this item is IDENTICAL to the OEM Filter you would purchase from the dealership. Same Make, Same Model, etc... Only difference being that this once does not have the VW or Audi logo on it.<br /><br />Highly recommend! Save a few dollars, get it shipped fast using Prime, and not worry about making a trip to your stealership, I mean dealership."
positive,Great value for the money!
positive,I like this fob cover. It’s a little stiff but I expect it to soften over time. It’s nice looking too.
positive,"Bought several for gifts and seemed to be useful in transporting birds in cages, as it kept the cage level and secured. For myself, it's a great idea, but not useful in my pickup truck, as it sticks out the front of the back seat. Works well in front seat, but when there is a passenger, there's no where to store it, so when I need it, it's home in the garage. If the legs could fold, it could be stored flat and sideways, it would work for me."
negative,Paid $90 for this 4 piece set that supposedly was designed to fit my car perfectly.  The front driver mat is incorrect and does not fit.  Very disappointed!
positive,"These are really useful around the house, I have tile floors and cleaned with this they are shiny (no streaks)"
positive,Finally a product that works!! Thank you so much!
negative,"2008 Wrangler JK. Awesome brightness improvement over stock lights. Got it with a discount to boot! Pattern seems well formed, but here are a couple of issues:<br />- the plug does not push all the way into the stock harness, so there is no way to lock it in using the red sliding tab. The plug is in pretty tight, so hopefully it doesn't loosen itself out.<br />- there is no way to adjust the inner metal piece that holds the LEDs to have the fins completely vertical, as you're supposed to with these lights. At best it's tilted at 40 degrees counter clockwise when viewed from the front; at worst, it's horizontal. I tried rotating the main black housing in every position before installing, which in some cases, requires forcing it into the headlight housing. Also tried the very limited rotation of just the bulb inside the black housing (rotate more than 20 degrees and it'll pop out completely). This creates skewed projections and the driver's light shines higher, which you want to avoid so as not to blind oncoming traffic.<br />- after 1.5 years, i'm seeing some mild flicker from low beams (haven't checked high beams). It's not terrible, but i'm reducing 2 stars, because from what i've seen about other lights, it only goes downhill from there."
positive,Terrible!!! Unbelievable blood curdling squeal and brake dust. Paid again to change and tossed in the trash can. Do not buy!
positive,Worked good. Did exactly what it was suppose to do. Here is the deal though. Fit and finish is sub par. If your not willing to break out the file and finish some of the rough edges so the pipe connectors fit better. Pony up the $175 TSI Cheetah and be happy. For me a very useful tool for $53 is good to go.
positive,"great tool to diagnose your check engine light yourself.  saves a trip to auto zone or wherever, quick, easy, on the go help and advise."
negative,Wrong bearing. Says upper bearing it is actually the lower bearing and the part number is wrong. Waste of time and money
negative,"First, I take this unit out of the box, plug it in, turn it on, it's loud!  I look, there is a dent on the back cover, and it is not due to shipping, this is manufacturing dent.  I take it off, get it straight.  It was hitting the plastic fan inside, making the noise.  It worked fine after that, drawing down to almost 50 microns if gauge is connected directly to it within a minute.<br /><br />In reality, it is cheap no-name unit, Robinair is a sticker that they put on it, and there is literally nothing in this unit compared to a quality stuff an HVAC guy would use.  This is not repairable unit, so it brakes - throw it in the trash.  At the same time, changing oil frequently is the key to success.<br /><br />In real application, it is slow.  I ran it for over an hour to achieve required values, and if you have no leaks that is a long time.  Time is money, so this will be ok for a once-in-a-while use.  It does get hot, nothing unusual.<br /><br />Two stars: manufacturing defect (no QA in China?) and obvious no-name unit with a sticker.  I don't do this for living, so it's fine.  This is better than a used high end unit requiring a rebuild after being abused by a pro.<br /><br />Cheers!"
negative,"Made of cheap light weight plastic, with a decal that won't last a year at most. Very dissapointed. Thought was metal when I ordered"
positive,Worked great in my 2008 Prius. I did get a few scratches on the back of my hand trying to change it without taking the bumper off. It can be done! You tube it and save some money from the dealer!
positive,"This is such a nice fit on my RAV4.  The only problem I had putting it on was those round chucks that slide in between the top and bottom of seat.  Getting my hand in without it slipping and snapping back was a little difficult.  It kept slipping and snapping back onto my finger.  But, once I got it on, it is holding nice and tight.<br />Took me a little while to find something to hook onto under the seat.  I had to go by pure feel because I couldn't get down enough to look under the seat.  But again, got them hooked and it's holding great.<br />Looks fantastic!  Not too much sliding around when I'm getting in and out of the car.  Love the look and the feel of this."
negative,"Don't think these will last more than a day. Not very sticky at all.  It shows them as car stickers, so I assumed that they were made for that.  I don't think they are.  They will all fall off as soon as dust hits them, or it rains. Or maybe even the wind from driving?  I would not buy these again or recommend them to anyone...ever<br /><br />Oh and you have to cut them all out yourself, because that is a lot of fun :P"
positive,"This works great.<br />Very easy to install, it took 32 minutes.<br />And another 10minutes to button everything up and  clean up.<br />The distance to start is good for me easy 40 yards and that’s plenty for me."
positive,"Have had them in the vehicle now for some time and no issues. Only thing we found was the bracket for the ABS harness was on backwards. No they were not worng left to right of the vehicle just bracket pointed the wrong way. Opened it up with screwdriver, turned it right way and squeez back together."
positive,Good strap!
positive,"replacement part perfect fit , no problems at all, Bosh plugs are my favorite because of quality and performance, highly recommend."
positive,Quality product
positive,Necessary item for OSHA regulations.  You can clearly see pictogram.  I'm happy to have found them on Amazon.
positive,We put Inside the car under the driver’s and front passenger’s dash and under driver’s and passenger’s seats so the LED’s are lit up in front and the back.  The LED lights light up really nice.
positive,Great switch with good tactile feel and multiple color options.  Ability to wire it a NO or NC with separate LED circuit provides maximum<br />versatility.
positive,Love it. Still have more open pockets for additional items.. wish it was a tad thicker though. Love the velcro on the back idea I think that is down right ingenious. Fits perfectly in a midsize SUV.
positive,"For some reason I have had an led fetish lately.  Light bars, fog lights, headlights, tail lights, tail gate strips, you name it.  Virtually everyone in my family has a pickup (large family) and I have been in LED installation heaven.  This tailgate strip is nothing short of amazing.  It is so easy to install, if there is such a thing as installing one.  All you do is stick it to the tail gate and plug it into your existing harness and that's it, you're done.  Nothing to it.  It is very bright, very distinctive.  Fully functional, has all lighting such as brakes, signals, reverse.  Awesome add on for your vehicle and also is a great attention getter.  Absolutely love.  Will be buying more.  I received this item at a discounted rate for an honest review."
positive,Love this So much! Bling everywhere!
positive,"Works perfect; 2011 Toyota, Camry."
positive,"Great sound, easy to use and easy to install if you your helmet ear piece has a Velcro or zipper opening. I have installed a set in one of my helmets that I had to cut the material and the sew it back up, even that worked great. Awesome price, great quality and value."
negative,"Works ok, but don't expect much of an air flow, also if you mount your heater that uses this fan on the wall you will have to put blocks behind it or you will have no air flow at all because the blower opening will be flat against the wall."
positive,Kills grease and brake dust.
positive,As advertised.
positive,worked well
positive,"Faulty sensor readings?  This is the tool to use.  Basic unit allowing you to concentrate a volume of water pressure in a specific area.  Crawl under your RV and find wires attached to black water tank.<br />Direct the spray in that area....In seconds the problem is resolved.  I used regular Tide Detergent with fabric softener to reduce any suds..added about 15 gallons of water...Drove around 5 minutes, stop and go slushing the tank and drained at RV site, added fresh water, drained. I didn't want the tool that spun around cleaning tank.  Wanted the ability to focus on single areas ( sensors )  PERFECT  this is all you need for $10..."
positive,Perfect
positive,Perfect fit. The only pain is the swap out
negative,I bought this as a gift. I was happy with it. It's pretty small though.
positive,Work perfectly in Saturn Vue 2002 3.0 engine
positive,Very satisfied with product
positive,perfect parts
positive,Buying groceries and flower pots and placing them in the trunk of my SUV always make me nervous because items tend to roll out when I open my car latch.  Now I don’t need to worry since the net will hold all items safely in place.
negative,It leaks
positive,Everything I was looking for. Hand strap is nice leather. No issues. Would recommend.
positive,works great
positive,I have had this installed in my van for 3 months now and it has absolutely saved my carpet.  It is great because it has a lip on the sides to keep all the spills inside.<br /><br />Con - It really makes it more difficult to get into the stow and go (but worth it for the protection).
positive,They work pretty decent. This was my second order. I shave my head and these work well between me and my motorcycle helmet.
positive,I used to wear a snap hook for years until the snapping part lost it's tension and my keys kept falling off. This is a nice replacement and probably upgrade in terms of look.
positive,Needed a cover for traveling.  Works fine.
positive,"This fit my '10 Escape perfectly. Simply remove the old one, and replace it with the new. However . . ..<br /> As noted, use of extreme care is strongly advised  when dealing with the gasket.<br />This can't be stressed enough!<br /> Use some bulb grease or dielectric grease on the plug. Sparingly! This will guard against water intrusion, and make disassembly easier if ever needed.<br /> I used a small zip tie as a hose clamp for the washer nozzle. Probably not needed, but it cost nothing for the insurance. Some have noted that the spray pattern of the new nozzle differs from stock, and it does, but it is usable in my book.<br /> I did not receive replacement mounting hardware. Rather than reuse the old, corroded screws, I had some stainless pan-head screws with a similar thread and a Torx head that I used. I slipped a washer of the appropriate size on them to give a better bearing surface.<br />Took me about 20 minutes to make the change, and worth it! The light isn't much brighter, but is more focused towards the rear. It also illuminates NOW when the brake pedal is depressed. A few milliseconds of safety might be vital!"
positive,"These are great stands for the money, no complaints here."
negative,Installed this on my lawn tractor and it would not supply enough gas to keep the 25 hp engine runing. I’m not impressed. I bought a regulator but did not need it. The pump is no better than the cheaper pumps. Save money.
negative,"[[VIDEOID:e63ff79da0a5809dc811cec694a7adb8]] Adhesive is not good and hold down the strips at simple bends curves (you will need to add on 3m Adhesive.<br /><br />The biggest issue is this:<br /><br />If anyone has a ford fusion, you know the amount of time it takes and whats involved just getting the headlights out to get to the wiring. Hours! I had to take off the front nose of the car (the whole bumper) just to slide the lights out to access the wiring. So I did that and one strip worked. And the other strip, the orange blinker strip is faulty. There is a middle section that didn't work. The daytime white lights work - just not the orange as you see in the video. I'm NOT happy after spending hrs doing this and I had to leave them on because I work and need to drive my car, so I had to put the car back together. Now, I have to spend hours again to replace these. It may not seem like a big deal to them, but it is to us when alot of us have to take so much time installing. So how brittle are these wires inside the strips? If you bend or twist them just a little, the lights fail? It's not about the money,  it's about quality and you want something that is durable. I had to take video of this to prove what I'm saying."
positive,"Worked great and fair price, do not have vehicle any longer"
positive,"Last fall, I broke my passenger side mirror attempting to maneuver past a truck on a very narrow side street. Now, I would not have been able to attach a new mirror, but I also was not spending $300! So, I purchased this replacement mirror here, on Amazon. The price was very affordable, and it did not bother me that it was black. My car is an iridescent white shade, and I could have purchased the white mirror, but the lower price of the black mirror is what I could afford. Next, my parent's neighbor was skilled in some mechanical work, and volunteered to install the mirror. It took him about 20-30 minutes. I feel so much safer when driving, and this mirror functions very well. Thank you, Amazon, for such affordable prices!!!"
positive,"Pros: Super super easy to install. Light temperature is crisp and white, not heavy in the blue range like a lot of 'white' LEDs. These are bright. Really bright. Additional notes on the brightness below*.<br /><br />Cons: They are... BRIGHT.<br /><br />*About the brightness, which is reason for the 3/5 stars for brightness and 4/5 stars overall.. I could crack so many jokes about miniature suns shining from your license plate and they probably wouldn't be much for exaggerations. They're bright enough I'm legitimately concerned they may be illegal in some US states (I know they'd be illegal in Wyoming, not sure about here in Nevada)  as you can easily see the LEDs ('bulbs') themselves at any kind of angle, their brightness rivals most backup lights, and they're not red or amber on the rear of the vehicle and constantly on. I covered roughly 90% of the lense with black tape to bring their brightness down to a reasonable level but I don't know how long that'll last as they do get really warm really quick."
negative,Put these on a year ago - now they have corroded themselves onto the valve stem and cannot be removed without possibly damaging the valve stem.  Would not recommend.
positive,Great fit and a lot cheaper than the dealership.
negative,"Matched perfectly. It was difficult to install due to chincey Toyota design due to the flimsy thin sheet metal mounting under the headliner. It was bent so I had to straighten it out with needle nose pliers. Not the visors fault but Toyotas cheap design. Actually the visor is cheaply designed or we wouldn't be buying replacements. Heck the whole Toyota is cheaply designed, amazing they do last and hold their value."
positive,it looks real good on the side of my trail rated badge!!!
positive,"Worked great,they look good are quiet and stop the Jeep as they should."
positive,"Excellent construction, appears the nuts are Grade 8 hardware."
positive,Thank you+++++
positive,Worked great on a 2001 Chevy Malibu. They come with the main lights installed and fit and look great.
negative,"My husband was replacing  the rocker arms, lifters and cam on my car.  One of the wrenches in this kit broke almost Immediately. Caused a complicated repair to be even more complicated."
positive,I bought these for my bf although they haven't been used on a trail yet he installed them very easy and they look great shining into the yard at night
positive,Works Great
negative,"I got this specifically to drain the used engine oil from a honda 4 stroke engine on a pressure washer.  The plastic tube is too big (circumference) to fit into the oil hole where the dipstick lives.  I could go out and look for fittings to reduce to a smaller tube but I did what I had to do, turn the whole darn pressure washer upside down to drain it."
negative,"Put in, 3 weeks later they started making thr same previous noises again, cheap quality here."
positive,easy to instal  ready to use within minutes
positive,good stuff excellent
positive,I wasn't sure what I would get and I was pleasantly surprised. These lights are exactly what I wanted.
positive,Exactly as described thanks
positive,Was a birthday gift and niece was very pleased with it.
positive,Perfect replacement for my truck also added the bracket so it will not crack again
positive,It fit great in my new 2015 Subaru Forester. I love it !!!
positive,This is a must have working on a Toyota Highlander.
positive,Beautiful.
positive,Daily wear.  Warm without excess bulk. Usual good wigwam quality.  Tops stay up but don’t cut off circulation.  Pricey but worth it.
positive,Good air filter
positive,When buying something like this you are buying the name.  One really does not know what you are buying.
negative,"DO NOT BUY this mat!!!!  The smell is beyond awful. I read a ton of reviews before purchasing this and knew that others had found the smell to be bad, but thought I could &#34;air it out&#34; before putting in my car. I let the mat &#34;air out&#34; for 4 weeks and the smell is SO TERRIBLE!! If it wasn't so bulky and hard to ship back, I would definitely return it. Instead, I just threw it in the trash. Save your money!!!"
negative,"Material is cheap and thin. Screen printed photo is extremely pixelated. Looks good from a few feet away, but sad looking up close. I don’t think this thing would last more than a year with any amount of sunlight. Saving grace was that it’s a snap to install."
positive,"Fast shipping, great price."
positive,"Works.  Doesn't smell weird.  No staining.  Easy to use, non-clogging spray nozzle.  I really like being able to use one product for complete leather care.  It's also nice to have one bottle for my car, shoes, belts, etc.<br /><br />Bottom line: totally worth it!"
positive,Works great. Stopped the Jetta from stalling and not starting up again. I could have bought a cheaper one but in my experience Bosch is usually better quality in most auto parts. Would buy Bosch again.
positive,"Surprised I never wrote a review! Probly cuz I was waiting awhile to confirm how good it is. I've had this on my car for a year now. It seems to give me a little better pickup than the factory belt. Don't notice a quieter ride but car pretty quiet anyway except for my CAI setup. I ordered a gator back a/c belt too. I need to have someone put it on for me. Think that's best to accompany it. I feel this belt connects too good & makes the factory a/c belt work harder.. perhaps slip a little? But yes, this is a good belt. I know the teeth setup is working to my benefit."
negative,"Despite the listing promise that there would be &#34;error free&#34;, I most certainly got instrument cluster error messages when using them. Don't waste your time."
positive,They are what i have come to expect from Bosch. zero streaking and very smooth. It really does make a big difference having a good set of wipers. i have tried a few different brands and so far Bosch still has the right stuff.
negative,The shaft broke off while hand tightening the light to my bike. No tools were applied. The metal appears very soft (almost plastic). Disappointed I’m outside of return window.
positive,The price and free shipping are a plus
positive,"Seem to be built sturdy, but haven't tried to cut anything yet.  My main beef is that I can only get a two finger grip, so with arthritis I hope I don't have to use them.  I think a T-handle would give a better grip and still fit on a visor."
positive,Does the job.
positive,Great purchase
positive,"Put this on my custom rug and so far it’s working, haven’t had any major spills so if and when I do, I’ll update my review. It covered a 10x12 rug but you don’t get a lot in a bottle"
negative,"The only reason I'm giving it three stars is because I didn't get the front cover that is supposed to come with it. I got one for my husband also and his came complete. No link to be able to contact seller, so be aware if you get one like mine. I like mine, it's soft, easy to use, and fits in my pocket, but without the top, in your pocket, you can easily push a button."
positive,"Goes round and around and around and around and around and around and around, so mant times I have lost count. Has to be in the kajillions by now."
positive,Was easy to install but instructions for wiring were incorrect. But once installed worked great.
negative,Disappointed! This most certainly does not fit a 2020 Toyota tundra SR5.  The fuse Box in the SR5 has a small lip around all of the fuses therefore it is unable to slide all the way down to make a connection.
positive,"It fitted nice in my type-r Honeycomb grille, I just purchased the emblem too , is on the way"
positive,"I have been using Wolfgang’s Über rinseless car wash for the last year, ever since we moved into a new apartment with no car wash close by. The Über wash works very well and the car always looks great after I go over it with my spray bottle's concoction of distilled water and diluted uber wash. I have also been following the washes with Meguiar's Ultimate Quick Wax spray wax. Eventually, I mixed the two products together to wash and wax in one easy step. However, Meguiar's Ultimate Quick Wax doesn't always come off easily and can require multiple passes with a dry microfiber towel to remove the haze left behind. The car always looked good afterward and the protection lasts because I keep following it up on a regular basis.<br /><br />Then I received the Wax Shop's Shine that Blinds Spray Wax and I washed the car today with a straight solution of uber rinseless wash and followed it with an application of the Shine that Blinds spray wax. I don't know what the people at the Wax Shop put in this product but they are not kidding when they say it's the shine that blinds. Holy carpe diem! This spray wax goes on and comes off like butter. It is so smooth I could immediately tell the difference between Meguiar's Ultimate Quick Wax and the Shine that Blinds Spray Wax. Not only did the Shine that Blinds go on and come off easily, it far outshines the Ultimate Quick Wax from Meguiar's. I couldn't believe it. I didn't see how it was possible to make the car look even better than it did already. Mission accomplished by the folks at the Wax Shop. I want to mention that this product is being used on my daily driver; 2009 Subaru Outback in Dark Bronze Metallic. The finish on the vehicle isn't perfect (nowhere near it) but the car looks amazing. For a show car, or for a collectible vehicle that you only take out on weekends, this product will make your paint POP.<br /><br />It's going to rain tomorrow so I'll be interested to see which wax beads tighter between the two products. Based on how it feels, my money's on the Shine that Blinds. As for which one will last longer, it doesn't matter to me as I reapply at least once a week (weather permitting). I absolutely, wholeheartedly, recommend this product. It lives up to its name and that's pretty darn good in my book.<br /><br />The only issue I have with this product is that I was sent the product with no sprayer. Amazon CS sent me another bottle to rectify the issue and, 2x in a row, I received the spray wax product with no sprayer. I had to use a new, unused, AmazonBasics spray bottle to apply the product. People shouldn’t have to go out and buy a separate spray bottle so they can use this spray wax. That’s ridiculous."
positive,Makes the dash lights of a bike actually visible in overhead sun
negative,"item was not smoked. it was lightly tinted, not dark at all."
positive,I bought this twice as gifts.  The recipients LOVE it.
positive,"Great price, easy to use and very accurate"
positive,Good product.
negative,I really liked them at first. Had lots of storage pockets.v the top strap kept coming loose. Second time I tightened it the strap ripped. Two days later the whole top ripped. It's no longer useable
positive,Great Product
positive,I used this yesterday. It is great for cars interior.
positive,Handy hook to hang my pocketbook on backseat.
positive,"Love these, they match my interior perfectly"
positive,Adapters arrived quickly and fit the application.
positive,"I use this everywhere. Really. Rugs, cars, pretreat oil stains in my husbands work clothes, you name it I've probably tried it. While it's not a miracle worker, it did help me get super grease out of my flocked fabric seats in the car. My husband borrowed my car and had to replace a hydraulic cylinder on a peice of equipment. He had super grease all over him and tracked it into my light tan interior :-/ Oops. I used everything under the sun to get it out including having it professionally detailed, I wasn't happy with the results. It was clearly still there. While this stuff isn't magic, after applying it, you wouldn't notice the stain unless I pointed it out. I am happy."
positive,It works just fine.  Price is right.
positive,Perfect fit.
positive,"Very funny, easy to put on and good price. Thanks!"
positive,The female electrical socket was not a perfect match for my 2007 suburban. The male connector still pushed in and worked but doesnt lock. Its just tight. I check it from time to time and its still in. Of course a trouble code would come on if it wiggled out from off roading.
positive,dislike did not fit
positive,Now I have a place to hold my purse and water bottle.
positive,"so far they work well. seemed a bit big for the tires, but they are working and holding air."
positive,Good size
negative,I plugged this into my SUV trunk charger and it flickered and did not work. I would not recommend this product.
positive,Perfect fit. It looks like the original. Good quality it seems to have.
positive,"Haven't used,  quality seems good,  still would recommend"
positive,This product does not only smell nice! It can actually clean my car but does not scratch off the paint at all.
positive,Excellent
positive,"Perfect trash cans. 5 gallon and 1 gallon. Light and tough. Not for liquids, metals, anything sharp will cut thought."
negative,"-Bought two,<br />-First one fell apart at its seams like a triggered social media politicker (the first laundry wash on gentle cycle),<br />-The spousal unit is a level 9 seamstress. I put the first mitt on a repair order with her,<br />-While I waited for that, I decided to order a second mitt. I planned to use the first (after repairs) for wheels only,<br />-Second one has held up fine so far after 7-8 washes,<br />-First one, after repairs, has held up fine since after about 6-7 washes,<br />-Much excite,<br />-No amaze."
positive,"Its great stuff. Adds lubrication to cylinder walls, plus upped my mileage.."
negative,Decent enough but doesn’t breathe at all. Even with the liner removed it gets really hot and uncomfortable even with the vents open. Hopefully the armor will protect me and make all the Sweating worthwhile.
negative,"Like most, I purchase this for the center bottom piece.  This would been a slam dunk 5 stars if the two side pieces includes the opening for the arrow to light up.  Sadly it does not.  It does have the marking for it."
positive,Smaller than I thought.
positive,2007 ram 1500 5.7L
positive,China made.  Not all connections to the vehicle were precise.  Minor fixes made it well worth the money.  Prices locally were twice as much for high grade salvaged parts
positive,Great led lights for what your paying for. Even with colored fog lights still bright enough on the road. So far no issues and cheap compared to parts stores.
positive,Works great!
positive,So far so good. I mounted this on my 91 Nissan Pathfinder with a VG30 V6 that a did a manual 5 speed swap on. No issues so far. Drives nice. No clutch chatter or slipping. The only thing I can complain about is the extremely tight fitment of the pilot tool in the pilot bushing. However it did work and all is good.
positive,Bought it for my youngest daughter’s car. It looked great. Thanks
positive,Exact fit and replacemnt
positive,nice addition to my 2010 FJ. :)
positive,"I've only had the chance to use the ice scraper once since I bought it.  My old scraper was chewed up, had chunks missing, and didn't do a good job.  This one scraped the frost off great.<br />I wish the handle was a little longer - I can't reach the center of my windshield without stretching.  The description is up front about this, so not holding against the product."
positive,I like that it waterproof and has the lithium battery recharging feature.
positive,Installed easy and fit perfectly
negative,It really didn’t do much
negative,"I just received, and will comment later on overall quality and method of functioning. I first noticed the alarm is very loud and sounds adjust accordingly. Problem is it is near impossible to unscrew the back of alarm to replace batteries. It comes with a mini screwdriver that does not work, and strips the screw head."
positive,Used for a upgraded alarm battery replacement.
negative,This battery lasted less than two months. Our fancy battery charger says it is a bad battery. Unfortunately the return window has closed
positive,Great motorcycle gloves
positive,Great quality
positive,I actually got this for my luggage. It is made to apply on glass or smooth surface..<br />I had to really take my time and rub this sticker into the molded irregular surface as it comes off the film. Took 15 minutes. It has held up to 5 baggage service/airports and it is holding up well.  Like the look and differentiates  it on the baggage carousel
positive,Works as intended no issues over the years. Cheaper than the other name brand competitors
positive,Very happy with my purchase. Will buy again.
positive,Pretty small but works good for holding my car registration. Keeps my glovebox looking organized
negative,"One of the Kensun 6000K HID bulbs turned itself off after about 20-30 seconds.  The other bulb stayed on, but its light was slightly blue, not diamond white, as if it's never quite warmed up.<br /><br />Unfortunately I didn't install these bulbs until over a month after I bought them, so I didn't bother to ask the vendor Kensun for a refund.  It was cheap anyway.  So I decided to cut my loss and bought a set of 6000K HID from another brand and vendor.  Installed them a week ago.  They were true diamond white and worked well."
negative,"Worked great for about a year, then my S5 Active with a case, started falling out even with the rubber strap around the bottom. The rubber strap wasn't big enough to go around the top too. End result, phone fell out while leaving the Orlando Airport, phone survived the impact...until it was run over by about 30 cars and several busses. I ride a Kawasaki Voyager 1700, so vibration was not an issue. I would not recommend this mount."
positive,good
negative,hard to install not the color I needed returned
positive,"I forgot to review this steering wheel cover when I first got it. But just the other day I happened to reach for my steering wheel and was still so nicely surprised with how good this cover feels, that here I am 3 years later writing a review.<br /><br />I bought this cover when my car was just months old to me. I liked my new car, but the steering wheel was really lacking and honestly didn't make me feel like I had control over my car at all times, so I just didn't feel safe. I have a small SUV and the steering wheel just made my car feel even smaller.  I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this steering cover, but almost as soon as I put the cover on, it transformed my entire driving experience in this car. I like driving my car and this cover is a large part of making driving enjoyable for me. I don't have really large hands, but before the steering wheel felt small. Now I have something to hold onto when I'm making turns or maneuvering my car and I feel tons safer.<br /><br />This picture was taken 2 days ago, three years after buying and installing it. It's still vibrant, shows no signs of cracking or wear, and although it was a pretty tight fit when I originally put it on, I'm glad that it was, because it means that there's not movement when I drive.<br /><br />I feel like my review is all over the place with effusiveness, but in short, it's great, especially for the price, and I'd buy it again today (if I needed one)."
negative,"Worthless, there are inserts that slide into the helmet , they fell out the first week while riding on the freeway, now it is useless.  Waste off money"
negative,This item was cut just a wee bit too wide.  As a result it wants to curl rather than lay flat.
positive,"Great stuff.  Only product I use on my motorcycle chains.  Stops new dirt, prevents rust, super easy to apply."
positive,30 for 16$?  That’s awesome!!!!! Good price! The size is just right for everyday use!!! Love the quality 🤩
positive,Just got them put them on. They fix nice and seem like good quality for the price.<br />Like em.
positive,great test very close reading compare to HONDA ED-18
positive,Seems to be working perfectly with my Toyota corolla 2003.  I've had no issues with it so far.
negative,"Well worth the money to protect your new vehicle.  Not your average floor mats, I noticed the drivers side floor mat buckled every time the door closes maybe a simple fix."
negative,It didn’t fit!
positive,Great product
positive,Great value for the money
positive,Awesome! Exactly what I needed to replace the stock starter on my 10+ years old Craftsman lawn tractor..........at a fantastic price!
positive,Great
positive,EXCELLENT
positive,"Not many times when ordering a part for older vehicles can you count on getting what you wanted. This aftermarket part is quality, better than the original."
positive,"I was searching  for an easy clean way to add a charging port to a 2017 CRF250 Motorbike, when I came across this product on Amazon. Not only was it an easy install. You will need to run the initial battery tender lead from the battery. Very good quality, love that it has a voltmeter. That was an added bonus I hadn’t been considering, but now don’t think I would be happy without."
positive,ok
positive,Purchasing a genuine Volvo replacement lens for a cracked lens on a 1998 Volvo is a very expensive proposition. This very inexpensive alternative fits perfectly and works perfectly.
positive,"Perfect size, and true.  Took 2 days to receive"
positive,Perfect fit
positive,Just a little too dark for my plates.
positive,"This is perfect fit for the back seat of our Nissan Titan. We didn't want to place bags of ice just on the floor of our new truck. Store to home, it's not a ice chest. Holds bags of ice and doesn't leak. We carry our grocery bags also so they don't slide everywhere. We can also use it with a bag placed inside, as a large waste basket for when we travel."
positive,Not sure how excited you can get over a trash bin; but suffice it to say: it is way more attractive that its competition & works as advertised.
positive,Perfect for what I needed
positive,"Reuse the original clips because the new ones are thin and will twist.  Futment isn't perfect but unnoticeable once installed.  Been a few cold weeks and no condensation inside, but no rain yet either though.  Time will test it.<br /><br />These lights switch the signal and reverse bulbs so the wiring will be tight, but it will still reach.  The lense cover is light (red version) so you can see straight into the bulbs and even the reflectors.  The bad:  looks cheap.  The good:  bright and noticeable when the bulbs are on."
positive,My dad actually smiled when he got this as  a gift.  Usually he growls.  He immediately attached it to his license plate.
positive,Looks good :-)
positive,Bought this for our son who rides & he was really happy with it.
positive,"Just received, have had one morning when was frosty, but mirrors were clean and dry. Easy to put on and take off and store, very happy with purchase."
positive,It works
positive,"The cord replaced the original cord that came on our 1998 Ford diesel truck. Working in the northern states in winter, it enabled my husband to warm up the engine on those really cold mornings. Have no idea why the first owner of the truck would have cut the cord off necessitating us to buying a new one, but that is why we ordered the replacement cord. Very reasonable price and prompt shipment."
positive,Matched existing...
positive,Fit perfectly
positive,"I echo all of the comments from the positive reviews.  One thing to reiterate is that without the lifts, the trunk is REALLY HEAVY.  Their web site recommends using a ladder as a support and it's great advice.  Even with one lift on, it's still much heavier than you are expecting.  Great overall instructions on their site too.  The lifts fit my 2000 Lexus RX300 perfectly and I can't believe how easily the trunk goes up now.  Highly recommended and one of my top 10 purchasing and product experiences on Amazon."
positive,"Excellent. Must have for your garage or any DIY projects to keep track of loose screws, nuts, bolts, washers, etc."
negative,"Not the best quality for the price ,don't be cheap like me buy best ine arp $69.00 its way better than this cheap quality tool"
positive,THIS IS AMAZING PRODUCT AND OVERALL EASY TO USE
positive,My husband has stopped losing his wallet and phone in my Toyota.  Has saved me hours of weekly drama!
positive,absolutely best OEM plugs. Highly recommend.
positive,You can hardly tell where the scratch was.
positive,Fits great and very soft. I love it!
positive,The key fob that came with my 2017.5 Nissan Murano was impossible to see what the buttons were. I would press the lock for unlock all the time.  With this cover it makes it so easy to see. On a side note with it being such a bright color make it easy to find my keys in my huge purse.
positive,"This is a beautiful sticker. In fact, this is the second time I've purchased it and I bought enough to give to friends that admired mine.<br /><br />Excellent quality, you will be happy with it."
positive,"I transport travel trailers.  This is a must-have item for anyone who tows regularly.  Coupling security becomes one less item you will need to worry about.  Heavy-duty construction, durable finish, easy to use.  Highly recommended."
positive,fit liked a glove
positive,I used this kit to mount a Smittybilt Overlander tent I bought used.  It worked perfectly for that.  I think the hardware for the ladder will swap over too!
positive,Very nice selection and will definitely save me money over time. Especially when you consider most cars require you to disassemble these when you do an oil change and they don’t always survive the experience. I also use them in some outdoor projects I build.
positive,Good quality material.  Fun bling!
positive,Worked great so far 250 miles no noises! Stops great! Came with everything you need to get the job done! Will buy again!
positive,As expected
negative,I thought the bristles were going to be softer on this brush. I scratched up my 2014 Corolla S rims pretty badly. I'll find other uses for it. I'd recommend you get a microfiber brush instead.
positive,"Great, buy it."
positive,Perfect replacement and easy to install.
negative,"Too much plastic on these bars and this makes them look like a cheap set. For the money they want for them I really dont see the quality to match it. Im so glad I found a set at my local parts store to look at first before wasting my own money sending them back, as I surely would have sent them back.  The plastic end caps are cheap looking imo & it makes them look low quality. Anyone who thinks they want these I strongly suggest you first try looking at them in person if you are able to as there are much better bars for this price or even cheaper, just look around."
negative,What a POS. It lasted a week before they literally one fell off in the garage and I heard something walked around and the garage then saw it on the emblem on floor. Brutal!!! So the inside it not solid so only contact (with the cheapest double sided tape) is on the edges as the pictures I took show. Don’t even waste ur time to stick it on the wall in a gas station bathroom.
positive,The product was exactly what is described and what is shown. Seller understands these times are hard to deliver because of COIVD-19. It was expected that it would take 3-4 weeks to arrive like my other orders but it came 3 weeks early. Great product and seller.
negative,Great quality but housings need to be deeper to accommodate LED's and HID's
positive,works great running 1/4 acre pond solar aerator
positive,Nice setup! Used with BX adapters for my D ring bumper. Perfect!
positive,"cute, but I only got 2 balls, and its wayyyyyyy shorter.  Cute but looks cheap and unfinished"
positive,Good so far!
negative,This pump SUCKS! I used it once it worked. I used it a second time & it turns on but won't pump any air into my bike tires. Heaven forbid I had a flat tire on the highway & needed to rely on this piece of garbage.<br /><br />I paid $31 for this & my old one from Walmart (that was $15) at least worked a few months.<br /><br />Never buying anything B&D again.
negative,Don't waste your money. Did absolutely nothing for the slightest dent.
positive,Fast getting here and awesome product! The actual key ring is a little awkward on the bmw key but other then that no complaints!
positive,"Easy to install, helps to have two peopleThey look great on the truck. They have been on for several months very sturdy and they do not get slippery when it rains."
positive,Hard to figure out!
positive,Arrived very quickly and is a very good product.
positive,"This's the rainy season so, it's on all my window sills"
positive,Inlet plug is easy to install with the help of a hole saw.<br /><br />It has good terminals and a nice rubber boot to cover them on the inside.<br /><br />The rubber cover seals tight and should remain pliable for years.<br /><br />Comes with black screws to secure it to your project.<br /><br />Worth every penny.
positive,"This is works great at supporting the motor while traveling.  I like it better than a transom saver, which seems to be hard on the finish on my lower unit.  It is easy to install and store.  The cost is reasonable."
negative,"They Rust all to Hell!<br />  These are made by Changzhou Wujin Hutang Hongsheng Machine Fittings Factory in China (aka: Hong Sheng Machine Fittings). Thats why they are rusted junk in only a few months. Shame on Gorilla Automotive for this. One thing to slap your name on a piece of junk but to not take care of customers is another issue all together. They ignore your complaints!<br /> Please understand this folks, these not only rust outside and look bad they are rusting inside & onto your cars studs ruining its threads...Remove them asap!<br /> AVOID THESE RUSTY HONG SHENG/ GORILLA WHEEL LOCKS & NUTS.<br /><br />Google this part number it should take you to see them 46440 with k670 .......Sold on Alibaba!"
positive,As advertised and arrived on time!
positive,I love the suction power on this small car vacuum. It fits under my seat. It also comes with some extra accessories to get into tighter spots.<br />Very happy with it.
positive,"This product dresses my tires nicely without leaving that shiny wet look, and seems to last a fair amount of time between applications."
positive,"Great price, seems to be a well made product. Fit perfectly"
positive,Can't beat this deal.  Just put them on so far so good
positive,"Our outdoor Ghost Controls solar gate runs off a battery box.  The battery box came with (2) 12V 7Ah batteries and those died.  I had one 12V 6Ah battery on hand, but needed another one.  A 10w solar panel charges these and they run our gate no problem.  No complaints or regrets."
positive,"In such a time, my cars stay in garage much longer then I can remember and it has saved my day twice, well spent money!"
positive,Belt is very thick and easy to install.  All around very satisfied!
positive,"Works great, exactly as expected. Length between front and back led strips is perfect for the average sedan. The app however is badly designed and does not work. Not a major issue however as the remote works well. Adhesion is great."
positive,"My review is relevant to a 2017 Dodge Ram Crew with the 6'4&#34; bed.<br /><br />Package arrived undamaged and a day early (on Labor Day)<br /><br />Very easy to assemble and install - I have a spray in bedliner and the dimples to drill the holes were already there so no need for a punch.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that the curved rails were not thought out enough.  If they would have designed it with less of a radius, it would have cleared 4X8 sheets of ply and drywall (this is why I bought it).  So if you are buying in hopes of carrying 4x8 materials in your 6' bed, it won't work.  I skimmed so many reviews looking for the answer, couldn't find it, so I went ahead and purchased."
positive,I love this organizer!  The change saver is especially helpful.  The Niro logo is nicely done.  Helps keep things from falling into a heap in the console.  Definitely recommend.
negative,"Fogged up real bad this winter, might be better in warm climates. Love the blue tint on lens . Make sure you put on a anti fog treatment before you ride out of camp...."
positive,It lit of my life! Lol. No it is a great product for my car. Good deal
positive,"my family makes fun of me for buying/using this, but it helps me tremendously while driving, specially when the sun is facing me. I only use it for daytime driving, I don't use the yellow tint shade at all."
positive,It even works as a tablet holder of you have a tablet case with handle.
negative,Says it fits 2001 explorer but it doesn't.
positive,Generic jack stands. They perform exactly as jack stands should. The car hasn't crushed me so they get 5 stars. I think jack stands are probably a 5 star or 1 star type product.
positive,
positive,Good car seat cover. Fast delivery.
positive,"I like this charcoal freshener. I think it is working. What I mean by that is when I step into my car I really don't smell anything. I think that is the idea here. It is fairly large which makes me feel like I got a good value for what I paid. I wish the rope that is attached was a different color, but otherwise I am happy with this product and would buy it again if I had to."
negative,looked already worn i can see why because they you need to buy one size up !!!! nice  boots sent them back got a refund right away i suggest the boa boot because the laces make it a very bulky boot
positive,Fit perfectly quality made
positive,It's great
positive,Great to show Baylor pride.  Ours is on the back of the car.  GO BEARS!
positive,Fits in tight and looks good. I do not feel that this will come out unless I take it out.  Great price as well.
negative,Not worth it
positive,"Sturdy, dependable and easy to use"
positive,Bought this for my granddaugther's new car.  Went on easily and is really cute.
positive,Makes the typical oil change much faster...not more dropping the bolt in the dirty oil!
negative,I needed a battery maintainer/charger that will hook up to my existing plug in connection on my motorcycle.  The clamps won’t work since the battery terminals aren’t easily accessible.
positive,Nicely constructed and makes for an easy disconnect in my battery charging circuit.
positive,Great Traction and looks
positive,What's not to like. . My bumper caps have become warped and worn fitting loosely.  I don't want the stinky slinky falling out of the bumper and getting dragged down the street.  I am replacing mine with these ones.<br /><br />They should do the job just fine.
positive,"These are great wiper blades, and to make them even better they come with refill blades so it's like 2 for 1. ---- I plan to buy more and just keep them on the shelf for all my vehicles."
positive,"Good quality cover for the money, Keeps the car clean and  free of leaves, etc  Easy to use, relatively light weight doesn't seem to scratch the paint Has a draw string to keep it tight although it fits my car ( 1929 Chevrolet 3 window coupe)  tight enough that I don't have to use it, Just the elastic bands slide under my bumpers sufficiently to keep it on, even in high Florida thunderstorm winds of 30-35 plus MPH.<br /> I bought a size larger than what was recommended, keep that in mind as others have suggested the same<br /> Good for 5 stars from me"
negative,Tire is terrible. Have patched twice and got another hole in it after maybe a mile. Denied my refund request too.
positive,Great for those smaller items sorted.
positive,"What a great oil can. It has a wide base that's hard to tip over and believe me, I've tried. proportioned"
negative,Really disappointed. No release agent in the kit so the glue stuck to the vehicle. Directions said use rubbing alcohol and the scraper. Scraper is too cheap and soft. Uneven edges. I have multiple glue spots all over my car and I spent 20 minutes trying to scrape it off. It looks so much worse now! I had to scrape so hard and for so long that the dents pushed back in. (They had not pulled out that much.) Dint bridge didn’t do the job. Instructions are a joke. Lots of pieces in the kit but no instructions on what to do with the majority of the parts. Overpriced for cheap stuff and made the damage worse.
negative,"There are advantages and disadvantages to this mirror attachment. It is easy to install, and should fit almost any rearview mirror. It also gives you a much larger range of view than the standard mirror.<br /><br />However, everything looks farther away than in my original mirror. My eye sight isn't what it used to be, so if anything I liked the view to closer not farther.<br /><br />Another downside for me, my original mirror has automatic tinting to dim others headlights. This does have a bit of a blue tint but it doesn't really do much for headlights."
positive,This was the best leather conditioner I have ever used. It renewed my leather couches and made them look like new. I will never use any other conditioner in the future.
positive,"God mirrors, I just didn't see that they are 10mm and I needed 8mm. Someone will need them."
positive,Got this for a friend who loves his Beemer! He also loves his hat!
positive,Product works as designed and is pretty sturdy. This is far superior to the cheaper trailer locks I've tried before that have a U shape to them. This is a nice lock
negative,I've only used it once...couldn't get it to work....used a 75 cent pick instead.<br />They got me.
positive,"Awesome part, perfect fit, pre lubricated and working perfectly.  Very pleased."
positive,"was actually the correct part for my old ass lawnmower, deere 210 1983."
positive,Works as advertised.  Made of a durable plastic with a nice coating.
positive,"As you can see, this car seat cover fits my Grand Cherokee Summit but does leave some gaps. That's okay because I wanted primarily for a little protection when I take my dogs to the dog park or to the lake.<br />No doubt about it, it's durable. Heavy duty construction, and paw prints wipe up in a jiffy. Looks a lot better than my previous canvas cover.<br />Takes no time at all to put it on. Very straightforward."
positive,What can I say.  They are hard plastic blocks that fit the door jam of the Miata.  They are half the price as other options online.  That being sad ...they are grossly over priced.  Even at half the price of other options.  ITS CRAZY THEY CHARGE SO MUCH FOR SMALL PLASTIC BLOCKS!  WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO ? CAVE MY OWN OUT OF WOOD!  MAYBE BUY 5K 3D PRINTER TO POOP SOME OUT?<br /><br />pros;<br />1000+ horse power<br />My door doesn't rattle over bumps anymore<br />easy to install<br /><br />Cons;<br />Grossly over priced<br />I doubt they truly stiffen the ride like others have said (seller does not make this claim)
negative,Don't waste your time with this product very cheap plastic very brittle the clips break every time you try to install this peace.
positive,"working well,so I ordered more."
positive,"Good thing this wonderful tool is sold as a 2 pack - after extensive domestic and international travel with no issues at all, TSA agents confiscated one at Dulles.  Glad I had a backup at home.  Well designed and small enough to keep handy at all times."
positive,Cool.
positive,"My son in law, who is a mechanic, tested this and said that for everyday people, it is very fast, accurate and worthwhile to own. He also advised that the only things better get sensors and things like that. Those cost a whole lot more. For the at home mechanic who wants to check their vehicle to see what is wrong with it, he said it is worthwhile to have."
positive,Excellent cover.  Material is very good quality. It's thick and comfortable. Also it does move when you get in and out of the car. Really easy to install too
positive,I like them. They are candid error free and the light pattern is very accurate. The light is white bluish but strong. I have a pair of sv.4 which are twice the price and the outcome is the same.
positive,Versatile and easy to install.
positive,So far so good.  Used it only once but worked well.  If it continues to perform as it has it will be a great time and back saver.
positive,Perfect fit.
positive,Would highly recommend. Perfect fit.
positive,"I've been using mine a little under a month - they are a new product released November 14th. Ideal for me. Once I got them seated in my snow ski helmet I was ready. First, I set up the volume on my phone AND using the volume control dial on the wire (volume is not set using the control button on the right ear piece). I put my phone in a pocket in my jacket and as long as the battery lasted on the phone I was good to go. To turn on music I press the right ear piece once, to pause you press it once again, double click the ear piece gets a new song, three times brings you back to the previous song, when you hold and release you can then talk to Siri or Google voice using the embedded microphone (as well as answer the phone).<br /><br />The manufacturer has a very brief video showing the audio system in action: go to the Outdoor technology website - select videos and the first video is less than 2 minutes titled ""Wired Chips"".<br /><br />For the price it will make an all around impressive to them, at a low cost to you, gift."
negative,"It's interesting since I've used Hawk HP Plus pads on street with at least 4 different cars including the integra type r, rx7 FD3S, E30 m3, and now the E46 M3.  Only the type R and E46 M3 have i used on the track.  the type r had no issues on track.  The e46 m3 at 3600lb with me in it had issues in 75F weather.  the pads began to melt and left some glaze on my rotors.<br /><br />another issue is how noisy these pads are, they used to be tolerable on other cars but after bedding again and again they are VERY noisy.  I'd recommend you either go with the street pads, or jump straight to DTC-60."
positive,"Although I ended up returning this because I decided I didnt need it, THISWAS A GREAT BUY. It was just as pictured  and a great price."
positive,Fit perfectly but was not really Porsche Carmine red as advertised.
positive,Works well and it's water proof.  I deducted 1 star because of it's size.  I wish it was bit bigger.
positive,replaced the old with the new and worked perfect. There is however light bleed through and its bugging the heck out of me.
negative,Did not work to large not as said to be
positive,"Questions to my husband:  Have you used your grease gun yet?<br />YUP<br />Has it worked good?<br />YUP<br />Any complaints?<br />NOPE, works like it's supposed to.<br /><br />For reference, he drives a big ole Kenworth as we are owner operators.  He takes good care of his truck.  He uses the grease gun about every 2 weeks.  It holds its charge well.  Compared to paying someone to do the work for us, this pays for itself.  Plus we write it off as a business expense.  Win win.<br /><br />Overall ... totally no regrets, hubs is as happy as hubs can get."
positive,"I enjoy decorating my car, and these flowers does the touch. Very cute."
positive,Blocks out a great deal of sun. It is awesome.
positive,I finally tried this out a couple weeks ago and was happy to have a no spill event. I used it on gas but will try diesel soon.
positive,Fits great and sounds great (well until I changed the exhaust now I can’t really hear it) lol
positive,Perfect for all types of molding removal
positive,"My Jeep loves it, runs much cooler now!  Nothing like putting OEM antifreeze back in after flushing the system!"
positive,Exactly what I needed for my 2011 Ram 1500.
positive,"Along with the other products from this seller, made my mustang interior look custom and classy, but not overbearing or trashy."
negative,"It's a sticker that fits in the plastic replacement center for the EZGO.  As far as stickers go, well it's fine.  Like others have said, it is pricey for what it is.  Typical stickers like this cost $2 or less.  I did an exhaustive search and this was the &#34;least overpriced&#34; of all the options out there.  In reality, the sticker should be part of the centerpiece.  So quality is a 5 and price is a 1, hence I gave it a 3."
positive,Awesome!
positive,Looks good and easy to install. Ac ouple of places do not want to stay put. Otherwise<br />an OK door guard.
positive,The helmet fits perfectly and is very comfortable.  I use it when riding around on my scooter so I don't want a big cumbersome helmet and this one is just what I was looking for.  Great quality.  Highly recommend.
positive,Good
positive,These fit my 2016 f150 crew cab sport perfect. The bend for packing went away in no time and your left with a quality product. Great thickness and texture. If your wanting a quality floor may spend the extra 30$ over comparable brands and get the USA made product and support American workers not the cheap Chinese made ones.
positive,Installed on my Motorcycles.<br />Get a good crimping tool and install under the seat inline with the connector for the brake/tail light.
positive,"These blind spot mirrors are super helpful with parallel parking, blindspots and seeing if you are in between the lines of the space you parked in. Love them"
positive,"These were the bump stops for my 2002, Dodge Durango 4x4 with the 4.7L engine.  They pushed into the mount easily and seem to be working just fine.  Make sure to keep your bump stops in good condition to prevent costly bottoming out of the body against the suspension."
positive,GREAT QUALITY PART. WOULD BUY AGAIN
positive,Quick service great product
positive,"As much as my OCD screamed at me for putting bright blue clay on my white car, it was oddly therapeutic to rub it all over sections of my car!<br />I was amazed at how much cleaner my car looked, & how grubby my little blob of clay had become!"
positive,Well made!!
positive,as advertised and works as it should
positive,It works.  I ordered a 2nd one for my husband’s bike.  I ride through some city roads to get to the bike path and no phones have bounced out yet🤓.  Neither of us have bothered with the lock feature 😎😎😎
positive,Worked perfect in my Lexus rx300- solved the problem and cleared the code.
positive,Very sharp
positive,"very bright , very durable"
positive,work as expected
positive,"Well made, nicely fitting product to protect the carpet for the 2012 Chrysler Town and Country we just purchased.  We take our dog and Grandkids to the beach in this vehicle and travel weekly. So nice to feel secure with this in place. Note: when you first open the package, turn the item upside down on the floor to let it reshape correctly before installing.  It stumped me, but my husband easily slipped in in the van.  You do have to move it part way to close up the stow and go 2nd row.  Easy to clear. Nice looking.  Best price on these on Amazon!!"
positive,"Works good, be careful putting it on and you will be fine."
negative,Please don't waste your money on this..... Unless you want JUNK.
negative,I don't know didn't work for me NOT VERY GOOD IT S--K
negative,Ok!
positive,Dad put it in his old malibu and it works well for him.
positive,I don’t know how to add a photo
positive,"Edit: Figured out my issue. Plugged this into my air compressor set at 150psi, and the gauge broke. Gauge is rated at 100psi, I subjected it to 50% more pressure than it's designed for. If you plug your toaster designed for 120v into a 180v outlet(if such a thing existed), you could reasonably expect it to fail too. I'm replacing the gauge with one built to handle the pressure, and will try again. Edited from 1 star to 4 stars. Didn't go to 5 stars because most home compressors are over 100psi, and Jaco really should be including a gauge that can handle those pressures.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />Overall the tool seems well built, but the gauge completely failed on the third vehicle it was used on. I'm a month outside the return window, so stuck with it. I'll be replacing the gauge, and hoping the rest of the tool holds up better.<br /><br />Even though the rest of the tool is decent, one star due to the failed gauge. The gauge is an integral and vital piece of this puzzle. Without the gauge, I have half a dozen other tire chucks that work just as well, and cost a fraction of what this does."
positive,"just what I needed,"
positive,Easy to attach.  Pretty.
negative,"The product is nice, it's made really well, I really liked it. Then I went to take a CD out and it was skipping like crazy. It was brand new so I knew there weren't any scratches on it. So I pulled all the cds out to look at them. This holder has left glue or some type of residue on all of the cds. So it has ruined well over $100 of cds."
positive,"I used this set to replace the rear wipers on two cars (Acura MDX and Nissan Rogue).  Both used regular, metal frame wiper blades.  Installation was a bit tricky.  I found two ways of doing this:<br /><br />1) As per photo, slide in the refill together with the metal rods from the old wiper insert.  It's easiest to do if you temporarily tie them together (see white twist-tie) as you go.<br /><br />2) Pop in the rubber insert into the wiper brackets to the ""second notch"" (don't bother trying to slide it).  Then, slide the metal rods in to the first notch.<br /><br />I'll update if any issues are observed."
positive,absolutely love it thank you
negative,"A I stated above they do not fit a Silverado that I can figure out and I have been installing blades for a long time being a mechanic.<br />Now if it had instructions, I have had a time or two where something did not fit and after looking at the instructions will show me."
positive,"These are the best when replacing your wipers. I live in southern California, and the sun takes its toll on the wiper blades, so that when it DOES rain, you get the streaky and sometimes rubber flakes from the degraded blades. These are the best and changing them is a snap!  Amazon offers them on subscribe and save, so you can check every 6 months to see if you need replacements!<br /><br />NOTICE: I did NOT receive this product for free to make an &#34;unbiased&#34; review. I paid for it myself.  I have NOT received any compensation to review the product. The above review is my opinion after having purchased and/or used the product.<br /><br />SO THERE!"
positive,Well it was just a stocking stuffers for my wife. To my surprise she really liked it. In fact bher friends are jealous and started looking for one for their fobs.
positive,A must have for hot climates! A good 10* cooler when using these shades. Careful at night could not see anything.
positive,"I had never bled my own motorcycle brakes, but this worked GREAT!!"
positive,Better quality than I expected
negative,application  4/10<br />package  10/10<br />this isnt for batteries that need repair<br />only works on smaller batteries<br />and the smart part well it isnt smart at all its programmed for specific scenarios<br />in my case it wasnt very useful
positive,Good solid well proven oil . Use it or Mobil 1.
positive,"Fit exactly around the bar with no issues.  I did have to place a small washer on bolt to take up some slack, but overall very pleased"
negative,"Gets in the way of the closing mechanism, preventing the power lift gate from closing. I returned this item and purchased another brand that fit better.  This was also more slippery than I had expected."
positive,"The jack stands will work as advertised, however, they arrived with numerous gouges in the steel and paint.  Cosmetically, they are one star, however, its a jack stand and bound to get damaged anyway."
positive,"I'm not a tech person so I couldn't tell you about its voltage, amps or etc. But all I can say is that the first time I used it, it couldn't have been any simpler or easier to use it.  The car of a friend at work couldn't start so I told him I had a portable battery. All I did was connect the supplied car battery cable to the portable battery and a blue light came on, once I connected the cable to the car's battery a green light came on and my friend then tried to turn on his vehicle and it started on his first try. It was that easy.  Forgot to mention before all of this happened I  had charged the battery almost 2 months ago and I had it in my car since then, so it looks like it keeps its charge for a long time. Very happy with this purchase and I would 100%  recommend this portable battery to anyone who doesn't want to get stranded in the middle of nowhere."
negative,"Super tiny, didn't stick well, feel off and list ot.  Very poor quality, the edge is cut very poorly."
positive,"tested today, it works perfectly. Just be sure to use a firm movement when you place the Tekton on the Tire valve. If you don't push enough some tire's air will be blown away from the tire. This is just common sense and you don't need to have experience to use it well."
positive,"We've had other snow brushes before, but they left a lot to be desired.  Usually by the second or third winter the plastic handle was busted off and useless.  These have an extendable metal handle, a brush that swivels (vertical or horizontal), and has amazing reach.  Also, the scraper is on the same end as the brush making it nice to just flip and scrape once the snow is off.  I expect these to last for many years to come.  Will update if it is like the others before it."
positive,excellent product.
positive,"Great product, I used Frost Guard before, & wore out my old cover (lasted 5 years). It’s heavy enough so it won’t blow away, easy to secure to car windshield."
positive,"Daughter-in-law loved it. It has bling, and she loves bling."
positive,"This is just so cool.  I need to greese one or two things once a while, so im not a professional with constant use. Small size very light weight is just perfect for a garage for seldom use.  Instructions are a bit useless but easy to figure out hiw to put the cartridge in.  Instructions dont say to remove foil seal from cartridge befire inserting it.  What is top and what is bottom of cartridge also missing.  Cartridge has a hard plastic rim around one end opening so you cant make a mistake as the rim end does not fit into tube.<br />With so little use, the small cartridge will least at least a year for me.<br />It is very essy to push the grease out no worries that trigger isnt very long.<br />I love it."
positive,So much better than the stem type.
positive,Perfect for power when you need it.
negative,Stopped working within a month.  This is my 2nd one!
positive,Fits perfectly.
positive,The size of the body is actually 14 inches. I was expecting about 20 inches. Used on 1976 silverado. Less money than local parts places. Sounds great.  It has a 2 1/2 inch inlet and outlet.
positive,"Great affordable upgrade/side-grade to stock. Look great and click/stay on well. Keep up with my turbo zx3 build and add a little more color under the hood. The labeling and lengths make it easy to install/re-install multiple times, so no matter how many times you have to tear things apart, you'll at least have your spark right. :)"
positive,Nice 👍
positive,Exactly what we needed.  No problems.
positive,"so far, makes my tractor start right up."
negative,"The good:<br />As described, seems to be a good price.<br />Easy to install: I’m a 24 year old female with little to no experience in cars, and managed this.<br /><br />The bad:<br />Glass seems flimsy, can’t withstand small rocks/ debris flying at it. Confirmed suspicions when at some point within a month of installation, one of them shattered and again needs replacing.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />If you’re selling your car next week and want to spruce it up real quick, this is for you. If you have some sort of film you can put on the glass to prevent it from shattering, apply that, and send me one too for next time. :)"
positive,Quality for the price is excellent.  Has helped keep the kitchen floor much cleaner from dirty feet coming in from the back yard.
positive,"But, Im not very happy that they have the Problem Solvers logo all over the covers. Be great if  there were an option to just get them plain or even have the logo smaller or only on one side of the covers.<br />Anyhow, they serve their purpose and actually look nice, considering<br />i think next time I'll just go with a regular shift boss cover and remove the plastic part and save $7."
negative,Great Product for the money
positive,Did what it was supposed to do used it on my 2001 F250
positive,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👌👍
positive,"Takes a bit to get this part in place, but doable even for the at home mechanic."
positive,It comes in two pieces plus mounting hardware. It is very well built and easy to install.
positive,works perfect
positive,Loosened up my rear end but good.
positive,Love having this extra safety feature. Wiring is not difficult -- accessing wires by dismantling area around headlight is the only tricky part. Works perfectly every time.
positive,Great price on some important off-road equipment. If you are off-road much at all these need to be in your stable.
positive,"Nice bright light, excellent value. I used these to replace the tail lights in my 2002 Acura TL. (If they fail prematurely, I'll update this review.)"
positive,Nice fit nice finish!
positive,"Great light, I use it for parades"
positive,"So easy to use and fits most cars. I have an suv and it’s perfect for my car and assuming it would great for sedans as well. I will mention my husband has a pickup truck and it’s slightly too big for his back windows however, we bent it slightly to fit and it still adheres."
positive,"Installed this a few days ago, only took a few minutes. I cut old wires, and soldered and heat shrinked the connections. Looks good works good. Not oem quality but will be fine for my 20 year old weekend warrior!"
positive,Don't fall victim to the auto-shop and pay $50+ for an air filter when you can do it yourself for less than $10 in under 10 minutes.
negative,It didn’t work
positive,Very good product and fit very good. Thanks.<br />Reference:<br />Honda Civic 2003 Ex Couple.
negative,"The compressor worked great but what a shame-no O-Rings, come on DENSO!!??"
positive,The best key chain. Classy and well constructed
positive,Love the antenna. It fits perfectly on my 2012 Mazda Mx-5 Miata. I still get all of the stations I did before too!
positive,They get the job done.
positive,Works as expected.  Delivered in timely manner and no issues.
positive,"Took a little effort to move wiring,  but definitely better than acid battery."
positive,These filter the cabin air in my car
positive,Not the easiest but probably the safest for the motor and it's components.
positive,Love it. Direct replacement. Did it because I had to change the water pump. Change the thermostat while you're in there!
positive,got one for my dr. its just nice to have. I dont trust the clamps only. drilled a couple holes and used zipties to secure it
negative,"When I ordered this it was described as &#34;Battery Tender Ring Terminal Harness with 2 Pin Quick Disconnect Plug.&#34;  My order confirmation states this.  What I actually received was &#34;Schumacher WM-12 Cable Connector for Battery Charger/Maintainer.&#34;  Even when I click on my order link it has changed to the Schumacher product description.  The original picture showed a protective cap and the Schumacher shows no cap.  If it had no cap I would have returned it, but it seems like it is equivalent to the Battery Tender product with the cap."
negative,Description said would fit 2004 Highlander but single hole 0n bottom is on wrong side of filter.
positive,Bought this for our 2021 Tesla Model 3.  It fits perfectly and slides easily.  We love it and highly recommend it.
positive,Just touching this u can feel how good the quality is. I love how the mystery machine looks. Very good details and very easy to clean. Highly recommend
positive,"These wipes are convenient, and work great to keep your tires looking new and shiny."
negative,lasted maybe 12 hours before the adhesive melted off😡
positive,"They work great for my 2015 Buick Encore. Now, of course they're not an exact fit, but they work for me."
negative,"I ordered the silver/grey set in April 2022 and loved them. They work well. I bought a second set from the same supplier in black but they are made differently. First, the silver set has two pockets on the interior, the black set only one, they sewed the extra beige liner shut!  The black set is stiffer but thinner and not as effective at blocking signals as the silver set either. I wonder if I had ordered another silver pair if they would be the same as my order in April 2022, or if the quality has changed in 9 months for all colors in general?"
negative,Working. The hose is made of good material. No bags to store in the trunk. No built-in flashlight.
positive,A little pricey
positive,Love love looooove my Jeep cover! Wish I had bought it a loooong time ago!
positive,I should have bought this years ago.  Its amazing.  I cannot add to what other have said because it just works and it quality made and seems like it will last for years.  Ive been using mine for several months now on a few truck batteries and it generally stays connected to my motorcycle when im not using it somewhere else.
positive,"Works well on old, scratchy sliders and pots."
positive,"Works great, on my 3rd purchase."
positive,Pretty hard to write something enthusiastic about a drip pan.
positive,"After weeks of online research, I decided to try Klasse All-in-One on my 2008 4runner. I had been using another brand of sealant since buying the vehicle three years ago. Now that the truck is ""getting older,"" I wanted to ensure the paint continues to look great.<br /><br />Here's my surface prep--(1) wash the vehicle well, (2) dry the vehicle using microfiber towels, (3) apply the sealant in the shade and (4) remove surface impurities with clay [I HIGHLY recommend the Pinnacle-brand clay].<br /><br />I applied the All-in-One by hand with a microfiber applicator. It is very easy to apply and easy to remove. I am very impressed with the All-in-One and don't think I will use anything else...I purchased a polisher and cannot wait until my pads come in to use the product for my second coat over Labor Day!<br /><br />The product goes a long way--I didn't use much at all. If you don't try it, you really don't know what you are missing."
negative,"Love the look and will keep it on my F450, but if you load your cargo bed at night you might pass on this unit.  Not much light when illuminated.  Cool yes, functional, not really!"
positive,"Good quality , perfect fit for van"
positive,Great!
positive,Perfect fit and solid feel. Recommended!
positive,"I mounted this on my beautiful Borgout custom chopper..the bars are 1 1/2 inches so I ordered the largest rings which were only 1 1/4 inches and went to work with my sander and bought longer stainless bolts..it took a bit of work but I managed to get them rounded to fit..the adjustment on the screen brackets are amazing in adjustment..it looks nice..small yet enough to sheer the Arizona winter air..I hate the cold but this handsome shield does enough to help.  I'll try to post some pic's..  I bought the gradient black...damn, it looks great..so many compliments.  gypsyjoe"
positive,This All Weather mat for the Model Y has a nice fit and is quite rugged.  It is designed to bend in the middle to allow access to the bottom trunk space in the Y.  The raised lip helps to catch any liquid spills.<br /><br />It has a good rubber texture and is non-slip.  This mat works well.
positive,Work great! Thanks
positive,"Fast delivery, no problems"
positive,We got this for my moms car that leaks when it rains. This has done a great job at keeping her car nice and dry. Would recommend!
positive,Have yet to use it but it fit the Mopar hitch receiver on my 2018 Ram 1500 Regular Cab. Looks like it is well built and will hold up well.
positive,"These are nice and bright. They seem to fit side specific and it would be nice if they came with screws. The factory ones seem easy to strip. These also don’t sit quite as flush as the OEM. We also got no computer errors!  Overall they work great, provide plenty of light and look good. Great price."
negative,Loved the sticker but was upset when I got it because it was all bent up.
positive,"Item worked very very well. Quick shipping, reasonable price."
positive,Excellent
negative,"UPDATE:<br />I figured out why this is leaking.  It appears the cap does not fit tightly, which causes the fluid to spill over the edge from standard driving.  When fully seated, the cap moves back and forth and can be shaken off the reservoir.  My opinion still remains the same….I suggest looking elsewhere.  I also haven’t received any contact from the seller about these issues, so they clearly don’t track their ratings.<br /><br />PREVIOUS:<br />I installed this on my 2000 Jeep Wrangler after bench bleeding it and after a week I appear to have a slow leak coming from the grommets that hold on the tank.  The core of the cylinder appears to get “wet” after a short drive and there are no leaks from the compression couplers of the break lines.  I will continue to monitor the leak to see if it changes.  For now, I recommend looking at a different brand."
positive,Works as described
positive,"Great for a cargo rack. Note that the wires protrude from a molded plastic nipple on the back of the unit, so you CANNOT flush mount this unit."
positive,Decent product.  Looks pretty good.  Be aware that it is ABS plastic chrome and not chrome plated steel.  I knew what I was getting and so I am not dissapointed. The price was good.  Installation was effortless.
positive,Killed the heat on my old 2001 jeep Cherokee! no more miss fires!
positive,"I use it all summer for my boat trolling motor battery.  I've used it on my ATV, car and emergency sump pump battery.  I've charged two batteries at once, left them plugged in for weeks at a time and they worked better afterwards than before I chaged them.  Even saved a couple of batteries that were left for dead.  It's paid for itself already.  Don't wait, buy it now!"
positive,Although I had to drive my car to blow up my pool - it served its purpose and I was happy with it. I'm happy I made the purchase.
positive,It is what it says. Heavy duty.<br />I keep this in my car to render unruly others unable to continue carnage.<br />Like drunk drivers or aggressive<br /> a-holes. I pull the valve stem rendering the car undrivable without any damage to the tires.<br />Additional feature is the handle has a protrusion for dealing with the bead while mounting the tires on rims that is perfect for rescue when a window needs removal fast.<br />Its also a Damn good weapon.<br />Great tool to keep secured in my car.
positive,Perfect fit with a great look.
positive,"This is a great backseat cover for my Toyota Camry that protects my seats from dog drool and dirt (and fur). First, it is well made and it's quilted design allows for extra comfort for my 35 lb Aussie Shepherd dog. It fits great and easily affixes to the two headrests to allow for stability and it will not move even when my dog jumps in and out of the car. I have put this in the washing machine one time so far and it came out clean and fluffy and all stitching was still in place. No complaints, just kudos for a great product."
positive,it did not work out but great support; would do it again.
positive,"Purchased this item to go on a road trip. The minivan started to feel crowded with wife, kids and dogs. The outside frame bolts together.  The floor feels cheap and light weight. I will update my post after taking it for a cross country trip.<br />2000 mile update: Drove from Chicago to Tampa and back with no issue. The cargo carrier held up very nicely.<br />One year later, still no issues with the cargo carrier. Looks like new."
positive,Really swells up in sun and heat
positive,"Fit great on my 2007 HD Sportster XL1200C. Allowed me to flip my mirrors under, and combined really cleaned up the look of the top of the bars. Build quality seems fine. Did not come with instructions, but it's self explanatory. See pictures for before/after."
positive,Better than the leather fob that came with my keys.
positive,The purple is good but this is the best ... I've completed my Quest
positive,Just received and installed. Looks good on 2016 F150. Was not as easy to install as I had seen in videos. Took me about 2 hours of adjustments. Seems sturdy enough and property in bed should be secure. Will provide an update once I have gotten on the road a bit and gone thru some rain.
positive,These works really well and led is where it’s at! They are easy to install. These are 20 times brighter than my old stock bulbs!! Now I need to change my fog light bulbs. Great price on these. I’ve had zero issues.
negative,Disappointed it rusted through so fast the whole pole looks terrible now still functions but disappointed in the paint job.
positive,The keys programed (one had to be programmed twice but worked the second time) and the metal was the proper metal for key cutting. Thank you!
negative,Nozzle broke on first use
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"Good quality product and works really well. Don’t know how long it will last since the hold down in the outside of the phone is rubber, but for now it’s doing it’s job."
positive,Good
positive,FLAWLESS ITEM AND DELIVERY
positive,Perfect.  2 minutes to replace the broken one and this works like the original.
positive,This is one of the BEST Oils you can buy! my opinion
positive,"these work fine, you will have to use your brain when installing them.  They are rubber and make an interference fit, it HAS TO INSTALL TIGHT or it would fall out.  appeared to be a branded product, not generic china."
positive,My water heater works great now.
positive,"I have used this product for  number of years.  I use it in my car in Florida and use it in my car in New York. I feel it is better than Stable when not using your car for a period of time.  Also, it cleans the ful system."
positive,"I'm very happy with this device. I carry a lot of things with my keys when I go places; small LED flashlight, Swiss Army Knife, 16 GB USB, remote control for vehicle, remote control for vehicle's stereo, etc. and the biner enables them to be removed and reattached very quickly and easily. The compass is a quality compass and works great. No complaints - this simple device does for me what I wanted it to do - keep my keys and small tools together, available, and easily removed when I need to use them."
negative,Not as sturdy as I had hoped. Drink holders not very useful. Can see if u had a toddler it would be.
positive,Looks same as origianal!
positive,Just what I needed for my old truck topper. Make sure the surface is clean when you apply the seal. Worked very well.
positive,fit car
positive,"Use in my Toto 2 cycle snowblower that would not stay running , worked great and now runs like it should"
negative,"Great price compared to the US version, but does not work consistently.  When it is cold in the mornings or the car has not warmed up yet, the sensor does not work.  Once the car has warmed up, it begins working properly again."
positive,"I bought these to replace the lights in my trailer. Everybody says they are better for the batterie and they don’t get as hot as the regular ones. Also I wanted to have a more white light rather than the yellow that the regular ones had. They are very easy and fast to install. I gave it 4 stars because they are not as bright as I thought they would be but that could be my fault in maybe not getting the correct lumes or what ever you call the brightness of them. And I don’t think they are more of a white light either, But that could also just be because i didn’t get the right ones. Some of them do seem to get a little hot. Overall I am happy with them."
negative,"I've used Anco blades for many years, and it now appears that I've going to have to stop. Recently, these blades started streaking on the driver's side of my VW Jetta.  It's a bummer, because they're so much cheaper than OEM blades, and up until the past year worked wonderfully.  I'm not sure if the design as changed, or perhaps this recent purchase has a bad rubber compound."
positive,"Dumping the sewer on our Fifth wheel is not the most fun, as you might well imagine.  And they aren't all the same size in the different parks we're at.  I saw this on TV on a commercial and came straight to Amazon to find it.  We certainly will be better equipped from here on out.  I also purchased the sewer end caps, which I really like."
positive,"Definitely better then I thought it was gonna be, quality product!"
positive,"Much less expensive than the cargo mats you see advertised, but does the job of keeping my SUV cargo area clean.  Very easy to cut to fit, only needed regular scissors.  Did have a bit of a rubbery smell at first, but it dissipated after a few days."
positive,This sign does the job it's intended to do. I think it's a little too flimsy. I think they could make them more sturdy so they don't topple over so easily.
positive,I'm totally happy with this item and how it works.  That part is worth 5 stars.  It looks and feels good.<br /><br />What I wish I realized before buying is there are no included instructions and to get the electronics out of your existing prius key you need to carefully pry it apart so it it doesn't damage the circuit board.  I found that starting to pry it open where the metal key normally lives was a good option (no electronics there to break.
positive,"When the NOCO Genius GENPRO10X4 showed up, I'll admit. I was absolutely shocked by the size of it.<br /><br />The GENPRO10X4 is roughly the size of a small carry on backpack, and weighs about 20lbs.<br /><br />However, if you need to do any kind of maintenance of batteries on an ongoing basis, this is a dream come true.<br /><br />I immediately hooked up several LiFePO4 Lithium Iron Phosphate Deep Cycle batteries to mine, as I use them to run my outdoor solar and water pump system. With this 4 bank battery charger I'm able to keep a rotation of 4 batteries in, 4 batteries out for when my solar system needs maintenance, or simply when I want to keep the batteries 'up to spec' on cloudy days.<br /><br />The genius thing about this is the fact that it is wet-rated as well as useful for reviving dead batteries just as much as maintaining good batteries. Because of this, I can mount this in my out building that is subject to higher moisture levels than the garage and not worry about it functioning day in and day out.<br /><br />The thermal sensor helps keep batteries safely charging and will automatically cut out if things approach dangerous levels. For example, I was charging a battery on a sunny day last week and this device was able to properly shut the power to the charge when it began to overheat. Excellent.<br /><br />If you need to charge several batteries, this is the one you want."
negative,"Does not work with my 2001 Xterra. The stream is aim directly at the ground about 2 feet from the rear bumper.<br />I assume this is meant for second generation Xterras, not first generation."
positive,"Bought these to replace my license plate bulbs. Been in for about a month now with no issues.<br />All bulbs operate normally, not as bright as expected, but for the price not bad."
positive,Hangers fit perfectly on our 2003 Ford F-250 -- easy to install
positive,"I use the red lights under the dash and under my seats.  I love the way they look, and they're,actually quite functional at night when I open the doors."
positive,My 20+ year old car likes this and Mobil 1 0W-40 (Euro Car Formula) from my local W-M very much.  It's a daily driver and I try to treat her right! (Approaching 109K miles!)  Thanks Amazon!
positive,"This is expensive, but works well.  And no ETOH in the gas."
positive,"This is a battery tender (keeps it charged) for a Deltran Battery Tender's line of Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries.<br />These batteries are designed to replace Flooded, AGM, and Gel cell lead acid batteries in power sport applications such as ATVs, SeaDoo type watercraft, scooters, motorcycles, etc...any vehicle or watercraft that has a compatible Battery Tender battery.<br /><br />This is a family owned company. Last year (2013) they started producing high output Lithium Iron Phosphate (LifePO4) Batteries and Battery Chargers.<br /><br />To me, this is what makes me have a LOT of confidence in the product as well as the integrity of the company...California has some of the most rigid and strict laws in the country for safety and efficiency of consumer goods. We have all seen 'not shippable to CA' on certain products.<br />The following is from the Battery Tender website:<br />&#34;Starting in 2013 all non-commercial battery chargers manufactured after February and sold in California must conform to the new “Appliance Efficiency Program” in coordination with the California Energy Commission.<br />Mike Prelec Sr. CEO stated, “Battery Tender® has been supplying high-efficiency battery chargers for over 10 years to the European market with the CE certification.

Eventually the rest of the country will follow suit!&#34;"
positive,"I have an F150 with a topper. I put these on the roof of the topper and wired them into my backup lights. I previously had xenon driving lights up there. When they failed, I replaced them with these LED lights. I didn't expect them to be as bright, but they are far brighter. My truck has a tinted rear window, plus the topper has tinted windows front and back. At night there was no rear vision at all. These lights fixed that.  The thing between the lights is my backup camera."
positive,"Ok, they work pretty much as advertised.  They stick on the side windows, and they somewhat blot out the sun.  You can still see out of them, but you have to put a bit more effort to see semi clearly.  I am happy with them as they stop the sun from hitting my face/neck from the side driver window."
positive,Was a terrific hobby add on.
positive,My hair always gets caught in it
positive,Great
positive,Great springs!
positive,"We bought one for my son and he loved it so much, he bought two more for his buddies for Christmas gifts.  They all love them.  Out doors, mud bogging kind of boys, what can you say :)"
positive,It was easy to install and seems more powerful than the original equipment.
positive,A++++
positive,"I had to modify the hitch to work on my 2016 cub cadet xt1 Enduro series 46&#34; hydrostatic riding mower.  I cut off both rear corners (corners with the holes) and drilled two new holes.  The vertical section of the Cub Cadet hitch plate is not flat.  It has two corrugations inline with the bolt holes.  I cut the corners from the hitch to allow it to fit between the corrugations and fit flush against the vertical section of the hitch plate.  The hitch is extremely well made.  Knowing what I know now, I would still purchase this hitch for my Cub Cadet."
positive,These look awesome! They were a little pain to install because of the car design.
positive,Easy to install. Perfect fit.
positive,"it does have a little whining noise-caused by the 12v dc  but for camping it work helps covers up the crickets.<br />good bit of air low med and high, not too big to have in your camping ""outfit""  stuff..."
negative,The quality of this product is very good i like the idea but it is too small
positive,ok
positive,Its a shame HD makes things you need speciality items to work on. You can make do without these but its much cleaner and easier with them. Being in a set like This is nice.
positive,Only thing I noticed is that a hitch will only fit so far into the receiver.  If the hitch is too long the receiver holes will not line up.
positive,Fit my truck perfectly amd keeps everything organized. Love it.
positive,Great product!
positive,Used to help with putting a fence in.
negative,"I ordered these plugs from another supplier. The day after order was placed, I was refunded my money and informed that the manufacturer has stopped production of the plugs I ordered.<br />Having heard good reviews about the Bosch 4501 plugs, I decided to search for them again from a supplier that possibly still had stock of them. I located the supplier through Amazon at a great price and placed the order.<br />The plugs arrived in a reasonable time and in perfect condition in the original boxes supplied by manufacturer. I installed them, but have yet had time to test them. By their looks, they are very different from the basic plugs you are a custom to. I believe that they will perform very well because of the 4 ground electrode arms which gives an additional 3 compared to the normal 1 electrode arm on conventional plugs The material used in the Bosch plugs is superior and hope for a benefit in either fuel mileage, performance or both.<br />Update: after driving for a short distance with these new plugs, I hate to say...not satisfied! I have been informed that Bosch has stopped production on these and I will be probably sending these back for refund or exchange. I researched the plugs in detail and they are definitely the right plugs for my vehicle. The plugs were misfiring pretty bad and had an effect like water under the distributor cap. I will be purchasing the NGK brand plugs to replace these Bosch plugs immediately. Sorry Bosch, this was a pretty big ball drop for such a high quality standards company.<br />Final Update:<br />Item returned for refund. Amazon is wonderful when it comes to refunds, thank you Amazon for you professional treatment of account refunds."
positive,good stuff!
positive,It came fast and I was very happy with my purchase . Looks good in my truck
positive,I really like this helmet and all its features and very functional. Have had people want to look at it. Very high visibility which is great driving on Hwy 49 N.W. Arkansas.  Fits very good.
positive,"Very well made, very good quality"
positive,Eyelets tent to come out if you lace up too tight.  Othewwise great.
positive,Product worked as advertised
positive,Very bright daytime running lights and I had no issues with hyperflash or error codes in my vehicle.  The lights work both in daytime running mode and high beam without issues.  They really give my 2011 Lexus GS350 a nice clean look.
positive,"This shade worked perfectly!  Gave us a little privacy and shade. It was easy to install and all the extras was great. It only came with 7 awning hooks, so order some more to be safe. It worked with 7, but I ordered more to be safe."
positive,"Can’t really argue for the price, but I wish it was a better fit."
positive,Been working like a charm now for 6 months bumper pulling up to 10k with it using a 1 ton dually Dodge.
positive,First off i will admit i bought some cheap china made ones that did not even last 2 months and they started to come off... Which they claimed to be 3M tape as well. So i found these while looking for another pair and glad i got them! They look a lot better and factory made and even better they are made in the USA and the customer service is extremely helpful and proud of what they sell A+++!
negative,"I have an 02 5.3L Chevy Silverado. OEM coils are the square type with bolt hole pattern vertical to motor, or inline with clip and spark plug wire attachment points. These are the cylinder type and bolt hole pattern is horizontal. Turning coil 90 degrees of no use because: 1. Bolt hole pattern doesn't line up with bolt holes in motor. 2. Even if bolt holes line up, clip wire not long enough to clip into coil in this configuration.<br /><br />Shame on me for not looking at my coils before ordering. Could have saved myself some aggravation! Also be aware just because Amazon says it fits your vehicle and the seller says ""Should"" in Q & A  it may not!"
positive,Easy install.
positive,"We were trying to sell our yukon xl Denali. These made the 2nd row captains chairs armrests look like new. Only missing one, but the two-pack made the whole area look nice."
positive,These blue wires look awesome when I open the hood. They are working fine so far!
positive,As described
positive,I had to remove an modify a small bracket that attached to the fender.  Otherwise  it bolted right up.
positive,"These were nice. Note, make sure you really pay attention to the spring before you remove your old one. It took me 3 different youtube videos to really see how it went on. Other than that spring, it was really easy to replace this. Crazy that Chevy made such a big flaw, but it seems that they messed up a lot of things with the Sonic. At least there are nice affordable things like this to replace Chevy's mistakes."
positive,not us ache as others that i purchased
negative,"This charger is made well, very solid, cost is very cheap, how ever its is unclear how long to leave the batteries on for charge. Do not leave any alkaline charger unattended, as bad batteries will leak and overheat. You must monitor any alkaline charger."
positive,works good saved money for not needing a tap
positive,Not the first Optima I've owned.  By far they've been the most reliable batteries I've used.  Red top is fine for the small pick up it went into.  I prefer the Yellow top for my Jeep because of the winch.  But very decent quality battery and worth the extra expense in my opinion.
positive,"I have a newer silverado crew cab and could not find a gun rack that fit in my window or looked good hanging from the headrests. I have tried laying them in seat, floor, under seat and none of these places could hold it in place. With this mount I have mounted it under my back seat. Now it is out of site it is secured from bouncing around it is easy to get to have had no issues since installing it I highly recommend this product"
positive,"This fits my 2020 4runner perfectly. Almost like an original Toyota accessory, very good quality"
positive,"Finally, something to keep crap in in my JK."
negative,Too hard to empty into a small mouth container like a gas can. I store old oil in an old plastic 5 gallon gas can and empty when full this pan is a bear when directly trying to fill the can. I have to use a funnel which is just another item I need to clean.
positive,"Ita fine, you can do a lot with this.  I put it in the back of my trunk to organize my emergency supplies that I always keep in my car."
positive,These work great for the luggage that wont fit in your vehicle. Comes with the strap and it is weather proof so you do not have to worry if it is going to rain or snow.
positive,works good and greasable
negative,"For about a quarter of the price of the manufacturer's offering, perhaps I shouldn't complain, but I will anyway... the fabric tore before I even used it the first time, and the little clips obviously need to be turned 90 degrees so they will stay on the headrest posts. Additionally, I don't know if the manufacturer's item would be better in this regard, but I can simply look through the side windows and see everything underneath the cover. Why call it a cargo cover if it doesn't cover the cargo?"
positive,Used this to mount by brake line CR style on my 2000 yz125.
negative,"Look at the attached photo. The upper chuck is the Tru-Flate chuck. The lower chuck is a cheaper chuck I have had for decades. Notice the triangular structure in the lower chuck. This keeps the chuck pin centered so it can depress the tire valve pin. Because the Tru-Flate chuck lacks this centering structure, the chuck pin floats freely in the chuck and it is exceedingly difficult to cause it to depress the tire valve pin. If you can't depress the tire valve pin, you cannot get air into the tire."
positive,This strap made for an easy lift.  Golf cart batteries are heave and hard to handle.  This strap hooked the and held on to lift it out.
positive,"These were purchased for a a 2020 Toyota Tacoma it said it would fit, as you can see the headrest is not an exact fit also the material is cheaply made for that reason I gave it 4 stars. I liked the style it made the seats look alot nicer even though they scrunched up which is normal with covers for the price not bad overall turns regular boring seats into something better and they do protect against dirt spillage ect."
positive,Easy to install and look great on my Jeep!
negative,It's just cheap looking.
positive,"Works well, good size.  Easy to use.  Many applications"
positive,"We got it for our Toyota FJ Cruiser, which can be rather a pain to reach across to scrape ice off. The ice scrapper part is a bit larger than my previous one and works better.  I like that it's adjustable and I can take the ice scrapper off if need be."
positive,Works great!!
positive,just as described
positive,Great
positive,"About 1/3 of the cost of the RV outlet store, worked perfectly!  Great product, great value."
positive,"NTK/NGK is the genuine OEM O2 sensors for Honda & other makes, so I bought this for my 2004 TL.  It is made in Japan & fits & functions as designed to.  I have installed high-flow cats, but I kept the original cats just in case, with the original O2 sensors still attached to them.<br /><br />Honda-stamped sensors (the sensor itself actually has NTK stamp, not easy to read though) cost twice as much as NTK, even though they are the same parts.  If you drive a Japanese car and if the O2 sensor fails, go with NTK at Amazon unless yours came with Denso."
positive,WORKS GREAT
positive,"This fit my passport really well. No smell, and doesn’t lift on the sides. Nice comparison to the weather tech mats"
positive,"Doesn't work as easily as it looks in the video. Works well, but requires muscle."
positive,I needed a replacement alternator and since I found my fuel pump here cheaper than buying from the mfg. I decided to check here first and I'm glad I did.
positive,Easy to install - doesn't slip - highly recommended for the price
positive,"The in-line channel vent visors are the most professional appearing, so it was what we set out looking for.  Several years ago had to buy directly from Lund (Auto Vent Shade). So glad Amazon offered these, as they are identical to ones we bought for an identical car.  Excellent fit, easy to install, and does the job they were designed for."
positive,Absolutely love this. Easy to use and works fantastically. Comes with a little bag to store everything in
positive,My dad loves it for his car or truck
positive,"Great tool, works perfect,instead of cranking down on it ,tighten up good and TAP clutch with hammer ,it pops right off ."
positive,"It did what it was supposed to and allowed me to easily code my BMW to fix error codes and also to reprogram some of the more annoying ""features"" that BMW insists on incorporating into the car.  Also allowed me to activate the Enhanced Bluetooth Audio, which was an unexpected bonus.  May try it on some of my other cars as well if I ever need to clear codes."
positive,"I was doing routine checkups / maintenance on a generator.  It started fine, but for some reason instead of putting back in storage, something in my gut told me to plug a tool in and check the power.  Sure enough, no juice was flowing to the outlets.  After some fiddling, it was as simple as replacing a fuse.  I searched my garage, high and low, thinking I had a stash of fuses somewhere.  Couldn't find any.  That's when I came here immediately and purchased a wide assortment.  Very simple insurance, and a much better price than most chain auto stores.<br /><br />I've only used 1 fuse from the pack so far–it's working as you'd expect."
positive,great
positive,"The listing said these were proper fornthemlarkomgnlughts on my 2015 Mazda, but they are NOT.<br />When I removed the plug I realized it requires a YELLOW colored bulb. OMG.<br />Do don't see that coming. I already opened the package so I suppose I'll just keep these and order more.<br />I would recommend<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B07HMQZ41X/ref=ox_sc_act_image_1?smid=A6M2FHZLRKPJW&psc=1#<br />If you need the yellow tint.<br />These do make great license plate bulbs, if you want to make sure your plate can be seen from a mile away 😂😂"
positive,"Comes with a Honda emblem to make it look genuine from afar, so that's a plus. However it is not of the best quality and required some precision trimming to be able to seat the blade in perfectly. It is vastly better than purchasing a new key for $125, when only the top plastic is what is broken.<br /><br />How long will it last only time can tell."
positive,"Looks great, really adds to the appearance of my Ram truck.  Installation was pretty easy, but the directions could have been a little better done.  It is holding up really well, and get a lot of compliments.  I added two LED light pods, the holes are already there and plugged with rubber plugs.  I added their tow hooks and the license plate bracket as well."
positive,I had to do a major head/valve job on my 2004 Acura TL (J32A3) and needed this to ensure proper seating of the valves.  It sticks very well onto the valve & valve seat.  This item is a must when you do a valve job.
positive,Great product for dual wheels. Use them on the motor home.
negative,Was Absolutely Garbage. I cannot say how disappointing this product was. First: The “Leather Fuller” was really bad glue they did not take in Dye. Second: “The Dye” goes on like paint and shows every brush mark and drys like paint with odor and inflexibility. This stuff is trash. Do not buy it will not help you fix anything but lighten your wallet. Instead buy some e3000 glue for the patch or repair and some quality professional leather dye. Which is cheaper and better in every way.
positive,Perfect for lap top
negative,Scent doesn't seem to last very long.
positive,Fits and works
positive,Looks great on my truck and works well.  Easy to install.  I did seal it with silicon
negative,"I used to love Purolator oil filters.  It is the only brand that I would use.  However, the last two have leaked around the gasket.  I won't be using anymore."
positive,Perfect fit and saved so much money by buying this and having someone put it in.
positive,"Penray offers air flow cleaner at a reasonable price.  It’s a 12.5oz can, so it’s going to last.  There is really nothing to it.  Just shake the can and spray.  It does a good job of dissolving goop that might have built-up.  It takes about five minutes or so to dry.  I haven’t seen better gas mileage, but I really wasn’t expecting that.  So far it’s working for me without any issues.  Really nice product."
negative,"Bottle leaks which means it may have gotten bumped in shipping. nothing too impressive about this product to match up with it's claims. I noticed that it will not make older dirty tires look very good, and does not clean that brown hue off of them."
positive,I ordered two of these key fobs. They work really nice and have good distance.
positive,"works fine on my bicycle parts, as well as other metal. Actually was recommended by the guitar tech that looked at my resonator plate."
positive,This will last 2 years .
negative,"Hi, I bought the stuff because I like what I read about it. It worked pretty good. In the box I got a coupon saying, if I promoted it on Facebook and sent them an email showing them I did this they would send me a free product. Well I did what they asked me to do and I got nothing in return. I tried contacting the company I don’t think they exist anymore. For that reason alone I do not recommend the stuff."
positive,Great
positive,My spark plug wires run close to exhaust pipes. This provides great thermal protection and is super easy to install
positive,Fits great
positive,These were an exact fit for my replacement wheels. Super shiny chrome
positive,Fit 2001 RAV4
positive,Nice set up but did not have instructions and had to partially disassemble the lights to get them to fit into the bumper. The led running lights are a nice addition and the halogens are bright.
positive,"Some people have difficulty with folding. After you do it once or twice it's really easy. If it were more sturdy it would be 5 stars. My Teraflex Jeep Wrangler sun shade is sturdy with a snug fit, folds compact and has attached fastening straps. This sunshade relies on the visor to hold up the corners and has a separate storage case. In conclusion, I couldn't find a better alternative for my 2017 Ram Rebel and have been satisfied with overall performance."
positive,"I have no idea how anyone cleans their car windows without one of these! I've been using a microfiber cloth by hand, and can never reach the whole windshield, despite contorting across the two front seats (while parked, of course!). The result was always a smeary mess, and I'd be lucky if I managed to clear enough of the driver's side to see the next time my windows fogged up, or the sun were extra bright.<br /><br />This window cleaner gadget made the whole ordeal not only easy, but actually kind of fun! I sprayed cleaner on the yellow microfiber cloth, then cleaned in a vertical motion from top to bottom of the inside of the windshield. After a while I realized I needed to go the other direction (horizontally) in a few areas to get rid of some streaks I had created, and I had to hop over to the passenger side to reach all the way across, but then it was done! The whole windshield was clean and totally clear, like new!<br /><br />I was so excited about it that I went around and did all the rest of the window interiors of the car. I was done in less than 15 minutes, I'd guess.<br /><br />The only downside was that in my excitement, I must have pressed a little too aggressively, and the cleaner handle disconnected from the head. I was able to pop it back on, and didn't see any damage, but a word of caution: Be extra gentle with this gadget.<br /><br />I didn't get a chance to use the grey cloth, which seems to be a bit thicker. I'm not sure how well that will work, given that pressing just a little made the head pop off with the thinner cloth. I'm also not sure if there are replacement cloths available for this - I can see that being an issue.<br /><br />I appreciated that a small empty bottle came with the kit, but I'm not sure it's safe to keep my favorite cleaner in the car in extreme temperatures, so I don't know if it will be practical to use. The cleaner arm is collapsible and could be kept in the car, but it's easier for me to just keep it with my other cleaning supplies.<br /><br />Overall, the product design is great, but the quality of the materials is a bit low, and I'm skeptical about the durability of this item."
positive,Not bad
positive,cleaned up the engine area great
positive,"I use this to secure 2 large totes on the 6' bed of my off road truck.  Took a minute to figure out the straps but once I got it right it works great.  Keeps totes from bouncing around, quick and easy to access.  2 years of abuse and still look as new."
positive,In a word: WOW!
negative,"Granted I bought this year's ago, with light use a handful of times per year, the strap finally gave out. However, I could never just shake off the sand...wasn't as convenient or easy to walk with...bit large and bulky. Will look for something slimmer next."
positive,"Probably the best stock-like filter you can get next to an actual Toyota filter, maybe even better!<br /><br />Performance filters are great for the Avalon 2gr engine as well."
positive,A+
positive,"These were the correct OEM style plug wires for my Jetta.  They fit perfectly, no stretching around / over the valve cover like some aftermarket sets.  I bought them with the other parts for a major tune-up and so received free shipping for all.  A fairly substantial savings over the parts store."
positive,It's pretty easy it works but it's just a little shiny for my taste
negative,I ordered four of these and only received two. I would like to replace them but it doesn’t give me an option as to why I am requesting replacement.
positive,Haven't used them yet but they look like they will be of good use.
positive,Perfect replacement for my Toyota Tacoma taillight.  Came with bulbs which I wasn't expecting.
positive,"Quality isn't perfect. But, at this price, I'd still recommend them."
positive,"So, I have a 99 Ram 1500. Replaced the broken one with this (13 MM wrench on the old one, 1/2 on this,, read on). So, I took the old one off (using my adult words to get in the tight space) and I tried to install new one with the old bolts. Thread was different. So, off to the local HW store with the item to insure proper thread and size and Wala.  It is installed. I would say it was easy but DAMN the tight area is no fun. Also, on my application I had to knock out the pin in order to get the tube on that goes to the bumper (used my own cotter pin to secure)."
positive,ok
positive,Great camping addition to clean and deodorize your tank.  Works well.
negative,"easy replacement. does not come with red sealer stuff on the threads. if it did, i'd rate higher. 99 xj loves it."
positive,Great products
positive,This wariness fit perfectly.
positive,I need a new coupler and this one did just fine.
positive,"So far they work great, I would recommend the removal, installation tool if working on VW Beetle."
positive,Bought this as a replacement for my damaged one.  Just like the first.  Well satisfied.
positive,It’s a super cool sticker just too small! Can barely see it
negative,"Installation was pretty straightforward. Paper instructions that come with hitch suck. Less than half of page used explaining installation. Plenty of youtube videos if you need a visual reference. The packaging was not good. Nothing to protect paint mine had several gouges/ scratches on it so i had to touch it up. Also the rolled steel rings that you would attach chains to were not welded on even. I could live with it but, bugs me everytime i see it. Overall hitch seems strong. Also when you open package dont get nervous, installation hardware is inside receiver."
positive,A cap full to 5 gallons works great. I've always been a car wash soap waster because I never felt it was enough. This stuff is excellent. Be sure to shake the bottle thoroughly prior to use as it will separate when it sits.
positive,I like the 180 degree bristles
positive,"Smoking deal plus got a mail-in rebate form! Too good of a deal to pass up. My 2002 Tahoe is running a lot better paired with the Bosch 09017 Premium Spark Plug Wire Set. I was afraid the gaping would be wrong, but they worked perfectly. I will definitely be reordering these when it comes time to do so on my wife's car!"
positive,Works perfect as the one was braking apart.
positive,Product works great
positive,Works great and smells wonderful
positive,"They cling very well & do not fall off. Don't seem to be dark enough for my baby who hates the sun in her face. I have seen other options in  stores & they have about the same tint though, so I don't feel like it's any worse off than the competition. The shades are small, but still 'do enough'."
positive,"Superior product , half the price dealership wanted and very easy to install"
positive,Replacement for '97 TJ older and not as bright as they were when they were original.  Very easy to install.
positive,If you have a camper you need to install to keep bugs out.
positive,"These are great! I installed low beam lamps in my Honda Pilot and have thoroughly enjoyed the new lights. Reflections are white, the road in front is well covered, and the pattern is just right. Thanks, BEAMTech!"
negative,This product stinks heavy of rubber/chemicals. My whole family sense and irritation in the back of our throats a short while after I removed the Floor mat from the box. My house now smells from it. I had to put it outside. No way I am going to put this mat into the trunk of my new auto. It will end up stinking everywhere in the car. I am sending it back. I hardly ever write a review but could not help myself.
positive,"Works like a charm on 2005 Excursion.  Solved my flasher relay clicking 24/7.<br /><br />The only difference i notice from the original switch is that it doesn't click as loudly when I move the lever or when the lever returns to its home.<br /><br />There are three Phillips screws on the bottom of the column and two torx bolts that hold the switch in place. Unplug two connectors and revesse process. Takes about ten minutes being very careful. That's it. The dealership charges between 350 and 400 for the part plus over an our of labor.  This is why dealerships are called ""stealerships""  by some.<br /><br />Do it yourself. Spend the rest on something for your family."
positive,"Purchased this to change the front differential/MT oil on my 2018 Subaru WRX. At first it wouldn’t fit down the dipstick hole, so I cut the lip off & it fit down perfectly."
positive,Very nice works great
positive,"I used this on the leather seats in my car. They were getting kind of work and getting close to cracking in places. This worked so well. The leather is soft now, and less cracked looking.<br /><br />I didn't follow the directions exactly, I did have time to let it sit and dry. What I did was rub the conditioner in until it was dry."
negative,I would NOT use these for any important hold down applications.<br />Very weak strap and the buckle is very poor.
positive,I was able to make this kit work for tethering a Stant brand cap to my car.
negative,Really expected a custom fit. I will modify it myself. Maybe it is a better fit for a different model. Not a 2016 Ram 2500
negative,"I agree with other 1-star reviews, which collectively cover all the weak points of this product. If you skim through them, you can consider yourself forewarned. As an ""alarm lite,"" added to other measures, maybe some will consider this alarm worth the price. I've concluded that any vibration-activated alarm capable of making a thief panic is going to cost more. So I'll keep looking."
positive,A simple as it gets.  It's an oil cap
positive,Sort of stiff ride. 2004 Tahoe.
positive,great
positive,Easy to use
positive,No more stinky frustrating hoses yay  makes the job a million times easier. Love it . Check the jet sprayerl before using ours was loose and nearly flew off quick fix just screw it in tighter.
negative,Even took this to a professional and could not be programmed
positive,I laughed when I took this out of the box.  I did not realize it was for a car.  I needed this size for the kitchen.<br />My husband said HE could use the cute little funnel for lots of uses for many gadgets that need oil
negative,I received white paint. Not red. Obviously was unable to use. The clear filler didn't work either.
positive,Works perfectly for the mini moto80 mini bike.
negative,H7 didnt fit the car... It takes 9005 headlight
negative,To small for my Niro KIA
positive,great price free fast shipping
positive,"Easy install and setup. Used the free Car Scanner ELM OBD2 app for iPhone, on my iPhone XR. Was able to clear Check Engine light on my 2010 Nissan Altima (Catalytic Converter), and on my 2012 Dodge Grand Caravan (Catalytic Converter, Small Evap Leak). While these are things I should get fixed, they’re not pressing, so it’s nice to be able to clear DTC for inspection, and do repair at a later date."
positive,"These are light weight, easy to Stack and lock in to place for storage. Easy to stack when leveling our motorhome (39 feet long). We had to stack 4 high in the front to level the motorhome. We purchased two set of these leveling blocks to do this (4 blocks high on both front tires). These blocks were sturdy with the weight of the motorhome. We felt save using these.  These block are long enough that You can used these on the rear with Dual tires."
positive,"Just installed it on BMW R1150GS (photos) and major points are:<br />- Very practical size for SLR camera, powered GPS or cell phone (inside map window), winter gloves, straps, misc stuff<br />- Securely mounts to curved tank with easily installed straps which can stay with bike<br />- Narrow design avoids handlebar bump (and annoying horn button contact on GS)<br />- Clever rain cover will expand up with tank bag and is quite secure, including anchor loops that go around bag's straps<br />- Looks nice, but can be easily removed and carried if it looks ""too nice"" to leave unattended<br />- Easy access to fuel cap if two front buckles are released and secured with strap keepers<br />- Build quality is very good but, as expected, not as heavy duty as tank bags costing over $200, especially map window<br />- Build materials appear more suited to highway use, not bouncing down dirt roads if it is heavily loaded<br />- No experience with its real world touring performance yet, but my 35 years of riding motorcycles and owning 7+ tank bags leads me to rate this one as a winner that will last a long time with reasonable care."
positive,Product was as described.
positive,"I think any claim of improved airflow or HP is BS, but this is a high quality reusable air filter, and that's what I bought it for, because my local auto stores are always sold out of paper filters for a 2015 Mustang GT.  I recommend it, even though it's pricey, because you'll never need another air filter again."
positive,"I bought it few months back and installed it recently and I just love the bulbs. It it very bright, more than what I expected. I installed it on my 2000 Toyota Celica and the installation was very easy for me and my old bulbs had no brightness at all. Now it feels awesome to drive at night. Happy with the purchase!!"
negative,Works well.
positive,Excellent for the Price AAAAA +++++++++
positive,"Didnt fit XG750,  no clearance to belt & sprocket whether onbaxle boly or shock bolt."
positive,"this is so better then it looks here, fits back of air pad case perfect went on easy comes with directions just read them and your set."
positive,I used these to mount driving  lights on my 3in stainless steel tube bumper.  Getting lights level and pointed was a big concern and these made it very easy to accomplish this task.  These have been on now for 3 months and holding great. I'm very happy with purchase.
positive,My son got these for his 2000 F250. They look really nice! Good buy.
positive,"I bought this for my nephew who was having a space themed birthday party when he turned 3 this year.  He wore the suit at his party for a little while and everyone loved it.  It make him feel extra special at his birthday party.  His 5 year old brother put the suit on as well, and he fit in it for the most part, but it was a little too short.  I also got him the inflatable space shuttle (that can even go in the pool) and he and the kids who attended the party took turns sitting on it and taking commemorative photos from the party.  The suit and the space shuttle were a big hit!"
positive,Perfect for drying!!
positive,As advertised. Well made.
negative,Used it all and it made no difference.  Would not order again.
positive,Love it! Great for our Honda.
positive,These have kept me from the frustration of dropping and losing thing between seat! They are worth getting and would be a great gift!
positive,[[VIDEOID:14a4d0809edddb70e56ee18febafd03e]] This headlight bulb set is up to 400% brighter than normal halogen bulbs. It has low heat and high power. Very easy to install in under then 10 minutes. Its waterproof so it works through even rain or snow so you can drive no matter the weather. It has an aluminum alloy housing that keeps the bulb safe and lit. It has the perfect combination of high and low beams.
positive,Nice unit and works well so far.  I have the sensors on my 34' Fifth Wheel.  Set up instructions were not good.  I had to download instructions from web to get good clear instructions.
positive,Great value and power. Replaced older battery.. Working well. Good choice. Would recommend.
positive,"Was the perfect gift for a friend that had to drop out of a marathon at the last minute due to an injury. I stuck this on her car and fortunately she can take a joke. The magnet was good quality, very readable, and had good magnetic adhesion to the trunk."
positive,The quality was much better then I  expected. Early arrival and a perfect fit.  I am going to buy one for another car this week.
positive,This product works well and is way cheaper than buying from the dealership. It was easy to install and looks nice on my car.
positive,"I wear this shirt a lot and wash it a lot, it has not shrunk or faded at all. good heavy material, not cheap feeling like most t shirts are.  I would purchase from this seller again in a heartbeat"
negative,"As soon as I plugged this unit (purchased here at Amazon.com) into the house current after attaching the alligator clips to my battery, it got blazing hot, smoking and melting the wires.  What the heck is going on?  There are no instructions in the box, and there is no indicator light on the unit."
positive,Works well
positive,"Love that this kit includes the trunk and drink seals and not just the door ones. I had bought another kit that only gave the doors, and it didn't solve my problems in the way that this did. Great product."
positive,These are a good quality but the rear mats do not fit as precisely as was expected for the price paid.
positive,"i like this holder .  Thank you ,"
positive,Bought and used these plugs on a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer 4x4 4.2L Straight  6.  Installation was simple and straightforward.  Theplugs have been in for 6k miles with no issues.
positive,These are great little engines for small karts or mini bikes. Can't beat the price either.
positive,"Sold the car since, but worked and fit well when I installed it."
positive,User friendly. This does read the fault codes and erase as I wanted it to do. But it does not read some manufactures fault codes. It cannot read my 05' Chevy Cargo van check engine light code. I should have spent another $100 and got the top of the line code reader. But it did diagnose 6 pother auto I put on it.
positive,"I have a mist maker on the end of it and it is running off filtered, inside water, so I know it is safe to use for my parrots' cooling device.  It is holding up fine after a couple of years so far."
negative,"The fan is easy to install. But, the air flow isn't adequate. Since it's not up to spec, I ended up returning it."
positive,"Good price, easy install, work great"
positive,"This lock is smooth, well designed and the instructions are easy to follow. They also have the greatest deal for free called &#34;key Safe.&#34; It took me all of two minutes to register my key. If I lose it, no..... when I lose it, I can easily get another for free or a small cost. Great added value. Plus, it easily fit my disc brake holes on my BMW. I suspect this lock can be drilled or defeated, but not easily. I would buy a secondary lock to slow down any thiref from rolling your motorcycle away."
positive,Fits like the factory originals. buy again for sure
positive,Easy to install - does the job.  Stays on.  Wish they had package of one - now I have a spare that I really do not need...
positive,"They work perfectly, I wear glasses and sunglasses both prescription so it’s nice to have more of an easy access to switch them out instead of the case. Very glam and well made."
negative,Terrible. Dirt magnet snd car didn’t look shiny at all.
positive,"Works great, look suggest, easy to install."
positive,This is a great product.  Very sturdy and easy to use.  I love the button that releases air while it's shoved into the valve stem.  You can easily get your tires exactly at the right pressure.
positive,good quality
positive,Just right for my car.
positive,"I recently purchased a 2013 Durango and wanted a hitch on it.  The available towing package cost $895 and I didn't really feel like spending that much since I don't actually intend to tow anything, I just wanted to be able to mount a hitch-mounted bike rack.  I found this and decided to give it a shot.  I do alot of do-it-yourself stuff around my house but almost never on cars so this was a bit of a risk.  The installation couldn't be easier.  The only things in the box are the instructions and the hitch; there is no hardware at all.  The hitch mounts using four bolts already in place on the vehicle (as best I can tell they are part of the attachement of the rear bumper to the frame).  The instructions are all of four steps long and steps one and four aren't necessary.  It says to lower the spare tire (step 1) but I found I had enough room with it still in place (so step 4; &#34;replace the spare tire&#34; became unnecessary as well).  You just take the bolts out, raise the hitch in place and put the bolts back in.  It took less than 20 minutes.  The only problem I ran into was trying to remove the bolts with a standard socket wrench; they were in much to tightly and I ended up using a 17 inch breaker bar with a 13/16&#34; socket attached to generate enough torque to loosen (and retighten) the bolts.  I suspect a long-handled socket wrench would work fine as well.  The tongue rating is 600lbs and the gross trailer weight rating is 7500 lbs so it should be able to handle some reasonably heavy towing, but I think if that's your plan, you might want to consider getting the tow package from Dodge; using this hitch won't provide you with all of the other stuff in the package (more powerful alternator, wiring harness for the trailer, full-sized spare, increased engine cooling), on the other hand if you only plan on light towing or using it for hitch-mounted accessories, this is a huge cost-saver."
positive,Keeps my CD's off the floor and all organized! I recommend this to anyone looking for this type of storage for their CD's
positive,Didnt work for my 2008 tundra but the tool looks like great quality
positive,"We had the order the Right light as another one we ordered was defective.  This one was also doing the same, would NOT adjust up, pointed to the ground.  I requested a refund & the company quickly responded with the refund & didn't require the product back.  GREAT customer service & much appreciated their response to a bad situation, as we received our full refund, no questions asked."
positive,As expected.
positive,Works great
positive,Very good. Thank you.
positive,Not bad
positive,They seem to work.
positive,works great~!!!
positive,Fit my RZR perfect. Stupid product description.
positive,"If you’ve ever had to drive from gas station to gas station just to find an air station that works and when you finally do, hang around waiting for someone else to finish using it,  then you can use one of these.<br /><br />This plugs into the cigarette lighter adaptor in your car and inflates tires up to 150 psi.<br /><br />I have a slow leak and this has changed the game! I should fix the tire but in the meantime, no more hunting for a working machine, or parking, going inside to ask them to turn on the free air, or if it’s not free, hoping the machine takes a card because I have no change.<br /><br />Not just for cars it comes with attachments for pool toys, bikes, balls that are stored on the device along with different modes for each type of item, I just use the manual mode though, and also has a stow away compartment for a bike tire attachment and for the lower cable itself. All packaged in a neat little carrying case that can sit in your trunk.<br /><br />This is one of the best car accessories ever made IMHO."
negative,Did not fit as described<br />Fitting on servo end requires commercial installation of one time use fitting not on this hose.<br />Very few steering hoses are like one size fits all socks.<br />This one was not even the correct diameter.<br />One case where I should have paid more attention when buying and the pictures and reality did not match.  This was my fault.<br />Supposed to fit but not ever going to.
positive,Does the job and saved me a few times!
positive,Worked great on my 1999 Silverado 4.8
negative,"Not what I wanted. would not stay strapped in correctly slid around, too thin"
positive,Worked great and easy to install
positive,Love them!
positive,I don't know about installation because I had a body shop install it.<br />They had to refinish some dings but I don't know if it came that way.<br />This part has to be replaced every few years because it is vulnerable to getting crunched.<br />So buy this cheap valence and know that when the time comes you can afford to replace it again cheaply.
negative,"Junk, they looked nice at first but after the first week they were rusting. Returned."
positive,"It definitely lifts and is easy to use, only downside is there's no good way to store the jack bar when you aren't using it"
positive,Great price
positive,"wear it daily on my commute. Nice jacket EXCEPT the mesh lining doesn't allow the forearm pads to stay in place (very, very annoying)<br /><br />*edit-<br />forgot that the zippers BUSTED at the loop, really cheap. The zippers still function<br /><br />*update - 02/27/2016<br />the white stripes are coming unstitched and separating from the main leather"
positive,Good quality. Used the base of these to make F-250 lights fit an E-350.
positive,good
positive,"don't extend very far, good but not good"
negative,"After doing a complete tune-up on my Honda mower, it kept on stalling.  I double-checked the oil, the spark plug, and the new blades, but they all looked fine.  As soon as I removed the air filter, it came back to life.  I put this filter back in, and it stalled out again.  I don't know if this filter is defective, but I cannot use it in my mower, and it is too late to send back.  I do not recommend this product."
positive,Very happy with this purchase.  I haven't had to use the safety disc on the road yet.  Can't imagine anyone not being able to see them.
positive,"Been looking for baffles. For 17in reverse cone  mufflers foe 5 years .the old glass pack burn out were too loud sound like crap . These baffles fit perfect  ,has good exhaust  note with ajust bolts left in ,more bottom and mid range power . I can't say enough how happy with them"
positive,"Wanted some more rumble than the factory dual exhaust on my 2007 Mustang V6 4.0. I ordered this system and saved money with the Amazon coupon FLOSPRNG (good til 3-31-13). I priced this axle back out at $389.00 just about everywhere online. Amazon has them for $310.00 and with the coupon end cost $233.00. The sound is awesome! Nice rumble great through the gear changes and not to much interior drone. I cant complain and could not be happier. This is absolutely perfect. After a quick call to Flowmaster, I was informed that this system is specifically designed for the 05-09 Mustang V6. The end result One Happy Customer, and one happy mustang, it definitely turns heads"
positive,"My boys are 3 and 6 and love playing with this, bought the hammer as well and made them a red cape to go along with it.  Love hearing them play and use their imaginations."
positive,Direct replacement for 02 Camaro.
negative,"Easy to install, not much louder than original horns. Also, a bit more bulky so stuffing the cowling on my motorcycle was a real challenge. After completing, the loudness wan’t anything to write home about.  More of a car sound but not louder than the original motorcycle horns."
positive,"4 out of 5 because there are a lot of these on amazon that are red. they all work the same and are great protectors. However, this ones photo's showed a darker shade of red than the others, which is the entire reason I chose this seller, but it arrived the same bright basic red that I was trying to avoid.  No big deal. good product, just misleading."
positive,Replacement part.So either it works 100% or 0%
negative,This did not work to remove scratches from glasses at all.
negative,You get what u pay for. Fits but the quality isn’t that great.
positive,Great for applying coatings their intended purpose and the plastic liner is the reason why.  Top quality.  Recommended.
positive,Great easy to use compact adapter that is a life saver.
positive,I use this net for my empty passenger seat to keep things from flying down onto my floorboard while braking or falling over while turning. Easy to install and keeps items secure.
positive,Bought two for crv Trunk .fit perfect for groceries.easy to fold up and store.Very sturdy and large.
positive,I  used a two bulbs to replace the burned out  bulbs in the exterior street address sign on the house.  Keeps it lighted all night.
positive,"This turbo is a K03 turbo but it’s a good one. I drove about 100 miles with this turbo and I can honestly say that this turbo maybe better than stock. I have a diverter valve and turbo muffler delete with a stage 2 tune and the turbo sounds good. You can really hear the turbo spool and it sounds better than stock. The serial numbers on the turbo matches a K03 turbo. I posted pictures of the numbers so you can do your research. I received the package in one day and all the parts are included. Was really hoping that this was a K04 turbo, but this turbo is not bad."
positive,"Auto heatshield folding works as expected! Easy to unfold and install, also easy to fold up and store.<br />Far better than the roll type sunshade."
positive,I need to rave for a second about how incredibly convenient and useful this has been. My family takes lots of weekend road trips and this has been a complete lifesaver. Even while we aren’t taking a quick trip I keep this packed with all things “useful”. So many compartments and easy to carry. You NEED this!
negative,Was not large enough
positive,good quality
positive,"Finally a garage soap that works well.  Pleasant scent, mild pumice that cleans well without the discomfort I felt when using pumice bar soap."
positive,Does what it is supposed to do and that is shine up my chrome rims and accessories.
positive,Was very satisfied with this product and fit
negative,Artículo regular no tiene un adhesivo muy resistente.
positive,Great product and delivered as promised.
positive,"This was a great addition to dads bragging about his Navy daughter. If we had another vehicle, we would for sure buy another! Great product."
positive,Decent outdoor rug.  For the price it's not half bad.
negative,"Will not fit Flex Fuel model as described, purchased this because of value, only to receive credit from Amazon for item."
positive,"I ended up cutting a lot of this down and grinding some angles to fit my frame. Every application is unique, and you should be prepared for some cutting/grinding. Not sure why this is painted because the paint bubbles when it gets hot from grinding or welding, so you're gonna have to paint it anyway. But the tube thickness is good for welding and is strong. Measure carefully and save yourself some headaches. These are often measured to the outer dimensions, not the inner. Worked out great for me, but I expected some effort as should you."
positive,Nice quality.  Very noticeable from afar.  Keeps rust off the hitch.
positive,Very cool!<br />Super easy!
positive,Gave as gift for new parents who live in Arizona.  Every time I was with them they had this shade up on window. They did say they would have preferred one that was larger.
positive,I was really nervous about buying it but it worked. No complaints yet
positive,Easy to install and use. Bought for my elderly mother to use in Arizona. The sun is very bright and this helps tremendously. She really likes it
negative,It's a big blob of a pad for the cargo area. Looks like I put a big black memory foam pad in the back.
positive,"Works perfectly but if you think removing scratches or water stain etching from glass is easy, forget it, it's hard.  Polishing glass would be hard with any rouge polish regardless of price, so this is actually a perfectly reasonable deal."
positive,"First time user.  Heard the scent was strange & wonderful so I had to try it.  Upon opening the package I was immediately hit in the face with the scent which then proceeded to invade literally every corner of the room.  I closed the adjustable vents but still had to take it out to my car because the scent was just too strong at first, even after putting it back in the box, in a drawer in my desk.<br /><br />I will report back after letting this air out a bit in my car, but, initial (strong) scent notes I get are primarily citrus & bubble gum, in that order.  I'm not entirely certain how I feel about it yet, but like I said, I'll report back..<br /><br />Also, for anyone having issues with authenticity; the seller I purchased from was CNS Motors, Inc located in South El Monte, CA.  It was not Prime eligible but shipping was free & quick.  Ordered 10/21, delivered 10/26, (would have been delivered 10/24 but I missed it).  Like another reviewer, I too, do not plan to purchase the separate fancy case for this, as it will just be sitting on the floor under my seat.  Yes the case looks cool, but I'm not ok with the adhesive mounting strips.<br /><br />I mostly look forward to telling passengers what it is when they ask..<br /><br />**UPDATE 10/28/15:  I have decided that unfortunately I do not care for the scent, but I have kept my rating at 4 stars because the performance of this cartridge is truly impressive.  I have frequent migraines & I can tell this scent would be an issue for me.  For those that enjoy a strong, deep, permeating scent, then this is for you.  The cartridge was only in my car a couple days, 1 of them, shut in the glovebox, & even now that I have a new air freshener, I still initially smell Squash when I get in my car.  I had to seal it in a ziplock at home because it was making its way into every corner of my house, just after sitting on the table overnight.  Hopefully I'll find someone that does enjoy this scent, that I can give this to because I really don't want to throw it away.<br /><br />Overall, I still highly recommend for the performance.  I just don't care for the scent, which I now feel is primarily bubble gum (plain BubbleYum to be specific), followed by a sour (not a bad sour) mostly lemon-y citrus.  It is definitely unique."
positive,Fixed the job
positive,These are great. The installation was super easy and they look good. Not so bulky/ugly looking as many I have seen. I put these on the front and back of my GMC dually and installed in minutes with very few tools. Made in the USA is a big plus!
negative,Decals came folded in half and impossible to get all the air bubbles out made the application difficult
positive,"This thing works really well. It's also rather compact, so if you are on a trip and can't bring  your rear stand with you, this thing can pack up on your bike and you can use it like one for chain maintenance etc."
positive,"I bought this rear brake hose for a old beater project that is a collection of car parts. 1927-1928 Star M frame, 1946 chevy truck front end, 1970 maverick 170 cu in motor with three speed manual transmission, and a 1967 mustang rear end 7 inch 4 lug...this rear brake hose looks just like the cut one i pulled off the rear end except that the old one was brass and this one was some kind of silver colored metal..steel? it fits just like the old one and the 1946 chevy brake lines fit the foward facing end of the hose. 1/4 inch fitting on that end and 3/16 on the two ends going to the wheels.  the brakes feel good."
negative,"doesn't fit right, came out moving from one side of the garage to the other...even though stationary it was snug."
positive,Husband's friend installed some Auxbeam lights for our Jeep. He says the wiring harness did the job.
positive,Recommended
positive,ok
positive,A very good buy. The auto companies are going overboard with formulas to try to lock folks into the dealer. I flushed my P.S. and it quieted right down.
negative,"Barely brighter than the stock bulbs on my 2013 JKU. Pattern is splotchy and high beams aren't much different than low beams. Also, the plug did not fully seat into the stock plug. Had to wrap a zip tie around it to make sure it stayed together.<br /><br />update: based on seller info, I adjusted rotation with the set screw. Now lights up correctly.<br />No instructions were included. And hex wrench not part of package.<br /><br />update: error codes for these bulb without a decoder are<br />B1638<br />B1634<br />B1630<br />B162C<br /><br />update: they flicker."
positive,This is so cute and not cheap looking. It has a little weight to it and sparkles so much when the sun hits it. I ordered the shortest one after reading some of the reviews. Some reviewers said theirs hit the dash or navigation. That’s why I chose the short one. This hangs perfectly on my review mirror. I love love love this item.
positive,My hand size is right on the cusp of Large and X-Large.  I ordered a large to try to keep the size down since I plan on using these under gloves for snowboarding.  Probably should have gotten XL but I'm keeping the larges.  Fit and quality is nice.
positive,Great item! Sun is completely blocked. It's super easy to put on or take off the car and keeps the sun off my little one.
positive,Love my carebears!!
negative,"It is convenient and very portable-- excellent for small tires, and pressure cutoff seems good.  Larger tires are more problematic.  Not very good for trailer tires requiring more than 30 psi."
positive,Just what I wanted
positive,Cant beat it for the price. Needed cheap all seasons for my spare wheels. They ride comfortably and make no road noise. Made in europe as well
negative,does not fit 2001 f150
positive,Good
positive,"no issues, i live in the desert, so the sun eats blades."
negative,I got this for my shower faucet and it works okay as it does get rid of spots but doesn't repel them.  We have soft water so was hoping this would keep them from getting any spots.  Going to keep looking.
positive,"$80.00+at autozone vs $30.99 at Amazon, you choose, so far so good, they are performing as it should be, high in quality but easy on the wallet, I'll update this review later on and only if needed."
positive,It’s easy to use and works great
positive,"I have a 2006 Lexus GX470, 230k miles. She's ghetto and cool. It is gold.  I thought I'd like the black, but it's a bit too dark for all my light interior.  The board cover is pretty thin.  You'll need to lay it out and leave for a few days to flatten. It's a polyester like material - like a shaved short super lightweight shag like - not velvet though?  Honestly, if you have black interior you might like it - for me personally, not so much with light interior.  Everyone likes something different right?"
positive,Its is too high to fit under the visors so I added a tube between the handle and the shift knob to hold it in place.
positive,"Worked as required, it's bracket mounts weren't perfectly seated so some filing with a rounded file was needed to make it fit in my 2003 Honda Civic."
positive,"I bought all three components of the system.<br />Only complaint is there seems to be no real personal contact for questions on what to buy.<br />But other than that, I am very, very happy I chose the Warn Provantage System. High quality and fit together without modifications,"
negative,"Bought this to paint a coffee table. It took a lot of experimentation to get this to work. You need to keep psi to 30 and use latex paint. Primer paint is too thick to use in this gun. Once I got the knobs set to the right position, this worked great. We will use this to paint other pieces. Also clean up is very easy."
positive,Clean and nice was not easy to install at all very hard to do.
positive,So cute worth every cent.
positive,Quality materials and it gets the poo and gray water where it needs to go.
positive,Absolutely first class. NO drilling. You need one 13mm socket and about an hour. One person can install easy. Strong...and very nice looking. I have had pickups my entire life....running boards were always a pain to install and take care of. The Best!
positive,Perfect OEM filter
positive,"Excellent product, good price"
positive,"Boyfriend just got a Rubicon - black with red accents - and this antenna was perfect to replace the ugly antenna that came 'stock' with his Jeep. Inexpensive, reception didn't change, and it looks great. No longer looks like a 1979 antenna trying to tune in a radio station on Jupiter. Or ""breaker 1-9"" with Smokey and the Bandit 😜."
positive,I bought this because it was recommended by the Chemical Guy on Youtube as a pre-wax method of removing particles in the paint.  I didn't believe it at first until I tried the plastic bag test!  Wow what a difference!  After using this stuff the wax after application and wipe down actually makes the paint look better.<br /><br />Do not drop this!  If you do just throw it away!
positive,These are great filters. Use them on my '08 V-Star 650.
positive,This support is better than the OEM ever was. Installed in 5 minutes. Fit my wife's 2004 Solara perfect.
positive,This product makes washing and drying the car a breeze.  I must say however you really do not need to utilized the PUR filter system to get the same results.
positive,Product was exactly what was needed & as described
negative,We bought a 5 gallon tube of liquid detergent. This pump did not work.
positive,I double them up and use 2 in each one!
positive,"I like this product because it is very easy to use and gives you an idea of what is wrong with your car before you bring it in for routine maintenance, inspection, or anything else.  This way you do not get ripped off for changing some part prematurely."
positive,"It's a socket rack. Looks nice, holds my sockets in more order than I had 'em before. My sole gripe - I've had to break several plastic holders, as in snap them off, to get a socket out. Some of them just hang on like grim death. Tip: spray the whole thing with silicon spray before you load 'em up, and this isn't an issue."
negative,I ordered the incorrect ones for my Ford short bed. Was alerted on web before ordering. Needed 4055 style
positive,Taking price into consideration these are great seat covers.
positive,This is the best product I found at the great price.
negative,"Did absolutely nothing after 4 coats. I called the company and apparently they said I was the only person that ever said it didn't work, which I highly doubt, and refused to help me. Do NOT waste your money or your time on this product"
positive,Looked cheap on the listing. It isn't. You do need a 9 volt battery for it to work so plan ahead. Fixed my issue so far. Remember to make sure you walk fast around the vehicle to make each sensor chirp. Aim the antenna at the stem of each tire. Do it right. Took me two tries because I was lit.
positive,"Simple, and does the job."
positive,"I would rather give this 3.5 stars, but 4 will do fine.  I purchased this specific unit mainly for it's ability to start a dead car or truck.  I bought this unit thinking I could make use of the air pump.  As a jump starter, I've used it at least 5 times now, in a few cases from a completely dead battery.  I've been able to use it 2-3 times in a row without a charge.<br /><br />I charge it for 24 hours every month or so to keep it working right.  The cables are a tad short for jump starting so you have to leave it on the engine somewhere or radiator shroud.  I have not used the USB charger but it's a nice to have.<br /><br />I bought this unit also because of the pump.  I liked the feature.  Having tried to use it, it's pretty useless.  It can pump up a motorcycle or bicycle tire but for any substantial tire it won't cut it.  Had the air pump worked.  meaning, pump up a standard tire to 35PSI i'd give it 5 stars."
positive,Great Product
positive,"So far, so good. Arrived in excellent condition, zero damage. ATF cooler line fittings were already installed, including quick connect springs. Fit just like the original."
positive,"These are great wipers...a little more pricey than many others on the market, but they work well and seem to hold up better than the cheap wipers.  The installation instructions are not great, but with patience, one can figure out the installation technique."
positive,We bought a beater for our son and didn't want to put much into the car. We installed these and they work great. Saved $300 from what the garage wanted
positive,great set of gloves.  love the fit and design.
positive,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️👌👍
positive,"Looks amazing, but a little hard to get it around the boot.  Unless you are supposed to remove the boot first, but still working on it."
positive,"So far I've had no problems with the transfer pump.  Just remember to take it apart and clean it out if you use it to pump gas.  I just take it apart and wash it out with mild soap and water, then spray a bit of WD-40 on all the parts."
negative,It doesn’t really fit if you are looking for perfect. There is no adhesive at all. I will probably get some double sided Velcro to place in 10 points to keep it in place… 3 inch strips should be good enough. The wrinkles will iron out in most places. I also had a steamer I used… probably prepped it for about 15-2.0 minutes. After placing on my dash I will be sure to Velcro certain places that tend to pull away from where it needs to lay mold to the curves of the dash board. It likes to pull it self in it’s own direction. With some adhesive Velcro strips I should be able to help it shape itself the way it  is designed too… the cut outs for the defrost and for the passenger side ducts could have been prepped better. They are just cut out… with some lining covering the edges such as they did with the outside would have gave it a more professional “look”. Some of the stitching is below standard. Not to bad for the price but not as advertised. The material should last a really long time and it’s not as rough as I expected. I would have gave this a better rating if it was actually adhesive in places necessary. I do not believe in normal driving it will stay in the place it needs too bc again it likes to pull itself out of place after just a few minutes. I waved my hand around it to see how flat I could make it. A few more dollars with some adhesive and Velcro strips will get you by. I won’t return it bc the options are slim outside of this same design. Could have been made with a little more concern and care to the customer.
positive,"For the most part a good kit. Light appears to be slightly on the blue side of the spectrum, but most people probably won’t notice. Light output is maybe just a hair more than the stock bulbs, so this is realistically more for appearance than improved  function.  I’m sure there are better bulbs out there, but hey, you get what you pay for. Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy with this kit, just don’t expect to be blown away by improvements other than the color of the light."
positive,"I work at a honda dealership, doing recon. I do a lot of tires, on all kinds of rims. When it comes to stick on weights this tool is a necessity. Yes it'll break eventually but you can file it down on the grinding wheel but eventually it gets smaller so keep a  supply in your toolbox. But it's awesome. It's so much faster than using a flat-head screwdriver or scraper. I love this tool, it makes the sticky weights come off like butter, 9 times out of 10."
positive,Easy to use
positive,Great for the undercarriage of the vehicle.
positive,"If you are new to RVs, buy this. If you’re old school and don’t have this, buy it. You will not regret because the day will come when you want to fill your fresh water tank with ease. This connects to your RV and secures your fresh water line to your RV. It’s a must have for all."
positive,"My KC lights worked just fine. However my covers had seen better days. After owning them for 5 years, I decided it was time to replace them. For being that old and in the elements constantly, I can't complain. I bought these replacement covers and my lights look like new again. Very sturdy."
positive,"Make your life easier, buy this coupler. Greasing zirks is quicker, faster, and much less messy than cheap couplers."
negative,These are fine and they work well enough.  The wire frame gets bent and twisted easily though and after a few times of easily folding them up they are now a pain in the butt challenge every time. But they do the trick and work well for guarding against the sun. We have a Toyota Sienna and they overlap a bit so the whole front window is covered.
positive,Worth the money
positive,"It was a little hard getting it on,but looks really good! You have to stretch it some when opening.<br /><br />Fits better than my cover I had on before this.  Covers I’ve had before make it bulky and slip around (even though were supposed “Non Slip”) a few would slip at times around the Steering wheel.<br /><br /> This one fits extremely well! And doesn’t Slip when turning (like a few past covers did)<br /> I’ve had several over 6 years and This is one of my Favs I’ve put on. It’s actually true to the description of “Anti-Slip Steering wheel Cover”<br />  Worth the price<br /> I only gave it 4 ⭐️ stars mainly due to how much of a pain it was to get it on.<br /> Suggest to the seller- maybe try a different packaging option."
positive,"Perfect fit.  After trying for<br />Several hours to clean and repair my old carb unsuccessfully, after 20 bucks, waiting 24 hours for delivery, slipped on this part, 1 pull and it started.  Thank you, lifesaver!"
positive,Very good. Thank you.
positive,i used this for a flag pole holder. worked great
positive,Made our Mustang and Camry look ever better. Good company with accurate description of their product.
positive,"I have been using Meguiar's for quite a while, mostly the Tech wax on my cars. My new car is the first black car I have owned. I used the tech wax, and was happy with the finish, but after speaking with my father in law, decided to try the black wax. It does seems to do a better job of keeping a deep shine on the car longer than the tech wax. I noticed that this wax is much thicker in consistency than the tech wax, much more like a paste wax than the other Meguiar's I have used.<br /><br />As long as I have this car, I will keep using the black wax on it."
positive,Wish I could get more
positive,Perfect size for my car. The plastic inner protection is a must. I like it!
positive,"This cover works great for my standard bed F150. I had used a tarp in the past to secure items above the sides, but never again. With the net and included tarp being able to secure to the hooks in each corner of the bad, I just use 2 additional straps on the bed rail hooks. And everything is safe and secured. Nice carrier to keep everything together when not in use."
positive,Nothing worse then having your wallet slide down the opening Your seat and the centerfold consul. And if you have big hands like I do there’s no way you’re able to get down there and pull it out
positive,This arrived way quicker than expected and in perfect condition. It wasn't bent at all. It is exactly what you think it is.. Perfect and beautiful.
positive,"Pretty thick, need to heat it if you're gonna bend it around tight corners. Looks decent from a distance. Clearly fake from up close, but I like it!"
positive,Price less than purchasing locally installed easily.recommend
positive,"I don't know what kind of mileage I'll get out of them, but they fit perfectly and, so far, with a few hundred miles on them, they're as smooth stopping as I wanted."
positive,This is my second California duster I’ve purchased and I love them so much. You can never go wrong
positive,They look great on the first day
positive,"Make sure you have it installed by a COMPETENT professional with the appropriate materials and relays to protect the vehicle systems. I had a RV retailer install mine and they still managed to fry my cruise control via the brake switch wiring on my 2000 Ranger. They installed it exactly as the etrailer.com site did, and it wasn't good enough, unfortunately. A quote for the repairs is pending."
positive,"Got my tractor back up and running. Was what I was expecting. My last one lasted a few years, so I feel like it's a good quality for the price."
positive,"We a family of 5 used this to go tent camping and it helped so much! It held all of our bags, sleeping bags, a table, air mattressses, blankets and folding chairs.  It’s very easy to install and tie down! Buy it!"
positive,I'm a rideshare driver and not only do they make you stand out in the dark amongst other cars but drunks love them and always asking how and where to get there own. 😂
positive,it really works
positive,I'd love a link to purchase this item again.. any help?
positive,Looks awesome on a gold equinox
positive,Great product
negative,"but it is totally different, so I can give it away to somebody who can use it.<br />So I can't tell how good this product is, i just can't use it....<br />If youa re driving a Ford Fivehundred than move on, it will not work."
positive,excellent wipers for XC60
negative,"They’re tiny, looks like cheap plastic"
positive,Exactly as described with fast shipping. Thank-you!
positive,Simple book kind of big but it does the job. If you want something compact I wouldn’t get it...
positive,Worked good. Helped me find my error code (O2).
positive,"Good size, easy to install will hold a lot of clothing in car"
positive,This is a great idea to store your wheel covers if you're not using them.  We had the wheels with just an aftermarket center cap and we were happy with that setup and look.  The loss to mileage was not really noticeable.  The only issue was how to store these conveniently.  Instead of using a packing box and trying to layer stuff between that we got this and it works great.
positive,I use this pressure gauge at ever RV site. It's a must for a RV. Some RV parks have 90 psi of pressure and will blow out your lines.
positive,Love them
positive,Bought this along with the required extra long pins for my 2019 Tacoma. Fits perfect in receiver and will be great for keeping my keys while kayaking.
positive,Fit the cam am commander good. Little tight getting the bolts on but that the design on the commander. Good fit and quality.  Like it.
positive,Good product to have in your car
positive,Thanks
positive,Bought this for an oil filter in a small space. It worked perfectly.  Durable and worked great.
positive,Seems sturdily built; will update if I use them.
positive,"While not the softest or most plush, these towels absorb a ton of water; more than the other brands that I have. I have three different reputable brands, Chemical Guys, Griots and The Rag Company and these are by far the best. Great absorbency, as I said, but also does not scratch the paint. I only need on on my Wife’s Infiniti and two will dry my F-150 Crew Cab. These are worth every penny, thus why I bought a second pack."
positive,"Nice light weight yet sturdy helmet.. Fits great.. Perfect replacement for my half now that the cold weather is here in ""Joisey"".... A plus"
positive,Honda has more circulation holes than others.
positive,Love E-Autogrilles. I have bought several and have never been disappointed.
positive,"very soft, nice."
positive,"Seels a bit larger than oem, but made it fit and it works great.<br />Very bright.<br />Only time will tell of longevity"
positive,Great price and works perfect!
positive,Will buy again
negative,"Looked good when first applied, but within about 4-6 weeks they yellowed and looked ugly. Fortunately I was able to pop them off."
negative,"The screw holes that mount the license plate to the bracket,are 2 totally different sizes!....."
positive,"Received  promptly, item is lightweight, very flexible, exactly as shown. Have not used it for anything specific, so don't know if will hold screw tension well, or come undone easily, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Easy enough if it does to put a tiny safety chain on so not an issue for me."
positive,Its a Light it is a Turn signal It fits my truck and was reasonably price. Four More Words Required.
negative,Will it fit? I am looking for tank bag but need to know if it will hold a samsung galaxy s3?
positive,One misinformed reviewer said Wackymart had this for $19. Something. Wrong the replacement flare cartridges are that price this product actually cost more a Wallymart..  I've been using these for decades thankfully never need it even carry one hiking but lol the expire but never had to use one.  They have a good reputation.  Better to have and not need than need and not have.
positive,Happy with this product. Very comfortable I would recommend it.
positive,Does a great job. holds up nicely
positive,One of my friends spent $240 on mats for his truck lol I did not
positive,"Excellent pads.  Low dust, no noise, good stopping power, no brake fade at all under normal driving."
negative,"Fun but decal isn't staying on. Applied properly, but after only 2 weeks it is peeling off on the corner and won't re-stick. Expected it to last long term, not just a couple of weeks."
positive,Fits perfectly on my Honda Motorcycle. Very secure.
positive,Great Product!
positive,Bought this for a friend for his new bike and he loves it! Great quality and finish. Def scaring the road goblins away with this alien face
negative,side panels do not completely cover seat  difficult to apply strap hooks on newer cars
positive,"New Denali 2020<br />It fit perfect, looked great, and all my RV friends recommended the MX4 for 5th wheel towing. Easy to get to all the bed of truck<br />Love it"
positive,The trunk liner is very durable.  The edges are designed at a height that is able to hold a gallon of liquid without spilling over onto the carpet.  A must have!
positive,"Fits perfect on my girlfriend's 2008 Toyota Yaris hatchback. Went on very quickly. I watched a YouTube video first to see about the installation and it popped right on, no trouble at all."
negative,"Tried to touch up a pretty significant series of dings down my driver's door. they were there when I bought the car. The paint is white with pearl, so I guess that's a difficult one to match, but as it stands, it's not acceptable. The paint just rolls out of the ding, leaving the ding fully intact. Also, after drying, it seemed at least 2 shades whiter than the paint on the car. On to the next thing...."
negative,"Corners bend up a bituch, Made for a smaller car but looks cute"
positive,Very nice.
positive,"Great replacement AC Accumulator Low Pressure switch harness. I had an AC system on my 98 SIlverado that was cycling on and off, but recently mostly off. This can be caused by low freon and/or a low pressure switch. I had an AC shop top off my freon but didn't fix the clutch cycling issue. The AC switch and harness wire are the next probable causes. The AC Low pressure switch removes easily and seals itself when removed. Cut the original two wires, use two butt connectors or solder this harness in and plug it into a new Pressure switch and this fixed my AC cycling problems. Now nice cold air! :)"
positive,Very Happy with my fitted LoGo HD cap. Wish more was out there. Love it
positive,Great
positive,With camper and camping equipment. Way better rebound in the rear.  Good ride.
negative,I but this on my bike and a day later my fuel filter exploded. So be very careful this is cheap and I'm not sure how well the vent works. You get what you pay ofr.
positive,"[[VIDEOID:ff820693921494b2db2a52db1a1aa9ec]] What I really like about this suction cup is that it can hold up to 240 pounds. I like to use in two, that way two people can carry a heavy piece of glass or an item that has a smooth surface really fast. Easy pump to grip easy peasy to release the piece. I highly recommend my friend, if you have a window, windshield etc. to put in. Thank you for looking at my review. I hope that it is helpful for you, if so please let me know by checking the helpful box below. God bless you. May the rest of your life be the best of your life.  Oran Z"
positive,Great scanner at a great value. Used this to diagnose misfiring cylinders in our 2007 Honda Odyssey EX-L. Has Bluetooth so was able to send report to my iPhone.
negative,Ok
positive,I don't really have the right word to rate this product. My bike sounds like a helicopter now and I loooove it.
positive,"This is the second battery of this type from this company I have purchased over four years. The product is very good and lasta a long time. Used in an alarm system.  The price was outstanding, as the same product goes for several times more from other companies."
positive,Bought these with new rotors and brakes still squeek before getting warm.
positive,"I've never been able to find a rear blade for my car that was truly streakless, but this has been the closest. Maybe it's my rear windshield that's the problem, but I've been most impressed by this one, even more than more expensive brands"
positive,Received the Black Boar ATV Rear Seat/Storage unit today and was as expected. Big enough yet sturdy enough with enough storage space too. The down side is you will need two people for easier install. I did it by myself and it was awkward but manageable.<br />Only downside my rack does not have enough crossbars so until I get longer u-bolts for the front area I used zip ties which placed in the right spots makes it immovable. Temporary fix only. Wouldn’t recommend it be a long term deal.<br /><br />Minus those minor adjustments needed I sat my son on the back of it and rolled down the road and he was comfortable. Going to get my wife on it with me for a nice evening ride.
positive,Arrived quickly and without any damage!!!
positive,This is a great quality item to unlock your door.  The glow in the dark rod is nice at night time and the included wedge other items are great as well
positive,Larger than I was expecting and that was great. They are deep just like I wanted. Very easy to trim also. They are perfect for my Van with the third row.
negative,Arrived bent and missing all branding decals.  Shipping box was undamaged so I suspect this was an open box item and not new.  It’s not as pictured in the ad or other reviewers photos.  Mine has the wiring connections visible on top others have them to the back.  I thought I could just rotate them but the housing is only drilled and tapped for one way.  This was the main selling point and reason I choose this over other brands as to not see the wiring.  It’s usable as is but not at all what I expected.  So far I’m very disappointed.  I don’t want to return it as now Amazon lists it as unavailable so who know when I’d get a replacement.  Oh and my fair lead is plain no branding and the hook is red vs galvanized like others.  Not a dealbreaker I kinda like the red.
positive,"If you don't have tinted windows, I would definitely recommend these things.  Easy to put on the windows, easy to take off, and easy to fold them back up!"
positive,"I have a ford Fusion and this wheel cover looks great in it.  It took a while to get it on, but once I got it, it was very snug.  I have the matching seat covers and they are both great"
positive,Nice to have your expectations met especially with this product!
negative,"It is cheaply made as I said in the headline. If you only need a gauge set for occasional use, this can NOT be beat. When I was younger I was an auto mechanic and has a really good, glycerin filled set (stolen sadly). This does not compare to that but it worked just fine for setting up my mini split."
positive,"Great stuff!  Keeps the fuel system spotless and small engines running great.  Techron is one of the only additives out there endorsed by car and power equipment makers.  Shell and Chevron include it in many blends, so if you use those brands, read the pump before spending for more."
positive,"Installed on Ram 1500 w/ factory hitch plugs.<br /><br />Took all of 5 minutes to install. Unplug main, plug in custom connector, plug main into custom connector. Done!<br /><br />Excellent way to add a 4-way connector without cutting into the wiring harness or using the provided 4-way plug when you want a clean, sterile installation for accessories."
positive,Fit like a champ on my 2015 Equinox. Installation wasn't too bad. Did it by myself in about 45 minutes and that included installing the wiring harness. Would highly recommend
positive,"These have been a great way to protect the carpet under my feet in the winter. They clean off really well with a hose and click into place so they don't move around on you. The fit is perfect for my car, there's a little cutout for the gas cover lever."
negative,The cooling fan in this is unnecessarily loud.
negative,"My last jumper pack lasted about 7 years, this one lasted 1.5 years and the battery is shot."
positive,Excellent fit for my 2016 Nissan GTR. Almost like NISSAN had made this net for the car from the factory. I have used the net to hold groceries from bouncing around my trunk. So easy to install in a few minutes.
positive,Does the job.
positive,I bought this for Father's day and my husband loves it. It makes leveling our Jayco Jay feather 24bh easier!
negative,"Holes for installation are crooked and hot big enough. So need to be enlarged<br />Material has small cuts and imperfections<br />It is MUCH bigger than the armrest. Since I wanted it ight and not to move around, I put fabric inside. As a reference, I used thin blanket, with relative thickness of this cover's fabric. It took 4 layers to make this cover tight.<br />Color of course does not match.<br />Material does not feel like leather at all.<br /><br />For the price they charge I would have expected much higher grade of material and much better workmanship.<br /><br />i wish I could return it, but it is already installed...."
positive,Fantastic tool to have.  Makes scraping so much easier.  Made very well.
positive,It worked really well. It did the job without messing up my dash. I use them for removing my truck dash.
positive,"I absolutely love these rear shades.  They work folks!!!  2006 Buick Lucerne<br /><br />PROS:  These rear window shades came TWO IN A PACKAGE (one for rear right side and one for rear left side.  I didn't know this so I ordered two packages but am keeping the second package as a spare).  The thin magnets were easy to slide behind the rubber on the door and stick to the door's metal frame.  As you can see in the second picture (Rt rear door), the door is open and shade fit PERFECTLY between rubber and metal frame.  It hangs lower than the window so I was able to let window down and still had complete coverage.  The third picture shows inside of the rear passenger (R) side with the window down.  As you can see, the shade just slightly below the door handle.  Now please note that while you can see threw this shade, it still provide excellent coverage from the sun.  When I tested driving with shades on and windows down, the Rear right side hung in there like a ""Champ"".  It stayed in place and still allowed air to pass through the shade.  You may not get the full force of air when the windows are down but you do get some air circulation to keep it cool enough in the back seat.<br /><br />CONS:  The length (upper window to door handle) was the same as the Rear Right (Passenger) side (you can see in picture 5).  The Rear Left (Driver's) Side width didn't seem wide enough for this window (maybe 1/2 to 1 inch) shorter, as you can see in picture number 4.  The magnet kept popping off the top corner of the door but even with that bit showing, it still provided enough coverage.  When test driving with windows down, this shade came halfway off.  I am thinking of using some heavy duty Velcro in that area of the door's metal and the shade to see if it will stay connected.  And last but not least, if you look at picture 1, you will see that you can't see out of this shade AT ALL like you can with the passenger side.  My Leon (2006 Buick Lucerne) does not have a blind side vehicle alert like the newer cars that let you know if a car/SUV/truck is on your blind side and I have to be able to look over my shoulder to see if I can safely pull into the next (left) lane.  Welllll, with this shade on, you can't see anything.  MAJOR CON.  I think I will write to seller and make a note of this if seller/maker does not see this review.<br /><br />OVERALL:  I really don't regret buying this and with the summer almost here and the sun is already hot and bright.  I know I will get plenty of use from these shades."
positive,"Less glaringly obvious than missing paint. If you are willing to apply,sand,level, put on clear,sand,level and buff..you may be able conceal the defects completely."
positive,I love plasti dip I use it all the time
positive,"This is my ""quick-rigged"" emergency power source for short term.  I have a 3000 amp pure sine wave inverter connected to these batteries.  I also have a battery tender so I can see how much juice is left in the ""battery bank.""  I also have a 200W portable/foldable solar panel so that I can charge my batteries up.  I live in Texas and during the February when we had the blizzard, I was without power to my house for five full days.  I've made sure that never happens again.  The 3000W inverter attached to this (and the other) battery allows me to run an electric griddle and cook a hot meal on a freezing day even if my house has no power!  Good, small size for storing when not needed, too."
positive,I ordered 2 because I have 2 vehicles. One motorcycle and one truck. I find it easy to secure them to my back pack and/or my jeans.
positive,"Has been great (2+ years), but now realizing that pulling oil to a turbo is best from other locations."
positive,OEM Toyota oil filter. What more can you say.
negative,Nice little storage product but don't expect too much for what you pay.  It does the job for me but I'm sure its not the best storage chest out there.
positive,As described
negative,I wanted to get the tiny pieces of dust/sand that get in the crevices if my car. It didn't get more than a vacuum would. I used it once and have stored it inside my house. I opened it yesterday to used to clean out my keyboard and it started leaving a sticky residue. I put it in the fridge for a couple hours and brought it out to my car. Same thing - started to leave a residue so I stopped using it. The scent is light and nice. I feel like it's ok to use once or twice but it's not something I can leave in my car to reuse like I thought I could.
positive,"Lube the keys BEFORE you break them in, clean and relive.<br />200 A no arc! I won't try higher without barrier ( under construction now) before final assembly.<br />I will go positive side: inside!<br />1. Nice and dry.<br />2. Nice and concealed!<br />3. Nice branch for battery bank (2 12 VDC  100 AH AGM's with a bus fuse to the negative.)<br /><br />I CAN CHARGE:  One ! One and two!  One two three or drain the same way.<br /><br />Two important things to remember:<br />Charge number one first!<br />Don't forget the switches!<br />( $2.00 Chinese voltmeters above the bank will tell you : on ~off~~voltage<br />Or bad news?<br />I prefer the individual mount meters with a :&#34; pocket cigarette plug have only&#34;<br />With one isolated in the truck and the portable in your pocket: you can go anywhere.<br /><br />After I get my : PHD in electronics, I'll be able to tell you about those radio sensor's and if they are any good/worth the $$$$.<br />My vehicle gages and computer tell me enough but that little : &#34; postage stamp&#34; voltmeter tells me if I can: start~forgot the switch or just distract me to stop more often to check ALL the meters and if needed get out the multi meter to find an occasional vampire or gremlin.<br /><br />Good secondary switch for the trailer, second truck battery or garage charging station!<br /><br />I got 2 then 2 more!😀<br />Love the brass lugs and something I can tighten and get GOOD contact, don't forget the lube/conductive preparation: that you can get at occasionally.<br /><br />P. S. ( If you're considering a bank set up get a ROLL of #6 or #4 with Tim & terminators. Heat shrink tubing : if your religion allows it? I use peel & wrap ( easier to inspect & rewrap?)"
positive,Before and after pictures here. No scrubbing! Sprayed it two times. Then rinsed with the hose! Easy Peasy!
positive,"the stikers are good ones,,,but they take so so so long to get here from Asia"
positive,I was surprised at the quality for the price. Great selection.
positive,These are so great!! And they're my favorite color! My boyfriend put them on for me and it did take him a little bit but he did just for me and they look amazing!
positive,"I bought these after seeing them on YouTube being used to dig up weeds. They're OK for that, but in all honesty nothing special over other things. I did use a couple on repairing a trailer tire and they did fine for that as well."
positive,Not much more to say.  Needed a new mirror after the passenger mirror was damaged.  Ordered this product and it fit perfectly.  Took less than 10 minutes to remove the old one and install this one.  Works and fit perfectly.
negative,"It's nice looking but very clunky and unusable. It was so big, my key couldn't fit on the ring."
positive,Great item
positive,"works well, great value"
positive,good
positive,I ordered 265 65 R18 for my 2016 Silverado to replace factory Goodyears that  lasted 78k miles.  I also got the suggested pressure sensors.  My local Chevy dealer I stalled for $104.  All in I'm at $760 on tire replacement and they look great and ride wonderful.  We went out in the mountains dirt road riding and they did wonderful!
positive,"Easy to install and seem to be very well made. I can’t speak to longevity as yet, but so far, so good!"
negative,"They do not fit, apparently needing an ""instalation kit"" even though it says it fits my specific vehicle. After finally getting the kit, they are horrible light quality. My hallogen bulbs are 5 times brighter... do not recommend."
negative,Junk complete junk cheap quality
negative,"Fell apart after a test plug.  Worst thing I ever bought on amazon.  I'm mechanically able, and after looking at the components, I could see that this thing was never going to work properly."
positive,Been a user for many years in several cars.
negative,These do not fit a 2018 Renegade.
positive,"Looks great, wind shield still got cracked though but who knows how many rocks it deflected. I would but it again"
positive,Awesome. Get it.
positive,We're very happy with this license plate frame.  It has weight to it and the wording is nicely centered.
positive,"The rear side reflectors broke on my Vespa LX 150 and these cover the holes, provide the same, if not better, reflection properties and look soooo much better than those stock, clunky chrome 'doorstop' shaped OEM ones."
positive,"These license plates frames are really pretty and the bling is shiny. It comes with two frames, four caps, four washers, four screws and extra rhinestones. There are clear instructions in the package and it is pretty easy to install. The only part that gave me a little trouble was putting the caps on because some of the rhinestones from the plates were getting in the way, but if you push a little harder they will lock on. Overall, they look really good on my car."
positive,Like
positive,"The vent visors fit perfect, I purchased this set for protection from the rain entering the car. Before everyone it rained and in roll down the drivers window rain would drip into the car. So I bought this set to eliminate the rain, well almost but it does make it dryer than not having it on. It was easy to install and car washes do not hurt or damage the seal. It's also a great sun shade. I really like this product, and as I wrote, it was very easy to install and the hold is tight."
positive,Good thick material and well made. A little difficult to tighten as string is elastic. Overall would recommend.
negative,"It is a little sloppy in fit for my main trailer hitch.  This is better than having two adaptors to get from 3"" to 2"" though"
negative,"This is runny not foamy. This doesn’t clean rain marks. Other cleaners work much better that I have tried. Albeit, I like rain-x washer fluid and window treatment chemical , just NOT this run of the mill cleaner for tough stained, buggy windows."
positive,We put these into a table my husband built and they're pretty study.
positive,Works great!!
positive,"Doesn't fit my steering wheel I waisted my money, I do not trust these people product, I'm not happy at all."
negative,I made sure this would fit my car and said it would.. not true at all .. in the back where u put groceries wasnt even one to fit. The back see floor way way too big  even cutting it wouldnt work. 2013 SLT dodge journey.. very dispointed returning it
positive,It was a great transaction worked perfectly!<br />Thanks!
positive,Perfect fit. Sturdy and easy to install
positive,Charger was easy to install and mount. It recharges the car so much more rapidly than the trickle charger that comes with our Nissan Leaf. It just makes having an electric car so much more joy and much less compromise.
positive,"Installed easy on my 14"" spare tire on my camper. It was so easy I thought I may have done something wrong. Stays in place with an attached elastic strap with hooks installed."
positive,Great filters for e great price!
positive,"I purchase this item as a gift, based on the strength of past reviews from verified purchasers: The party that received the item loved it."
positive,"For the price, it is a great value! I was looking for a quality shade, but most I found online were in excess of $50 and up.If you want a good, inexpensive windshield shade look no further. I bought mine for a 2000 Chevy Silverado and was going to buy the large size. I ended up buying the medium size, and it fits nicely. A large would have been to big.,  Before you order, measure your windshield and check the dimensions on the shade you are considering. The storage bag included is nice, but honestly, I have never used it. The shipment also included a couple of adhesive no slip pads I have no idea how to use, but feel they are not needed."
positive,"I have used this stuff for years in auto restoration. It will clean just about anything but you have to be careful on some things as it will sometimes take paint off or dissolve low grade plastic  It is not just for brakes, I clean all type of parts as well as many things around the house. I clean my hand tools after a messy job before putting them away. I hate going for a wrench and finding it with grease or oil from the last job."
positive,"The OTC Tools 6982DGS Drilling Guide System tool helped to create  a perfectly centered hole within a broken exhaust manifold stud.<br /><br />Some tips, use a small old camera to take photos in an effort to check the started hole to ensure the hole is centered.  Continually check the hole while drilling as well as redundantly checking the hole depths against the length of the studs, to ensure the hole does not compromise the engine block water jacket.  Use drilling oil/paste.  Prevent the drill bits from over-heating while drilling into metal."
positive,"Fit well, I had to cut slit in the circular part to fit"
positive,Son absolutely loved this item. Ordered for his Ford Mustang. Very fast delivery. Great item and service
positive,"With the current health climate and also prices we decided to change our oil ourselves.  Our vehicle is actually easy that way.  This is the recommend weight of oil for our 2016 Dodge Durango Limited.  Have had no problems while using this oil.  At the time we purchased it, it was the best price around.  No complaints or regrets."
positive,Works well
positive,Just what my husband wanted. Word of advice take headlamp assembly out for easier installation.
positive,Great product. Only 2 very minor negative thing. 1-Wish the bars were labeled which one is for front of car and which one is for back. Shorter one for back and longer one for front. But perfectly fits my 2015 toyota highlander. 2- socket tool provided for mounting nuts was poorly made and did not fit nuts. No problem for me cause I have tools.
positive,Comes with everything you would need to install. Just the right border thickness so the authorities don’t give you a hard time over it.
positive,Have these on the front of my quad. They are very bright and haven't had an moisture build up inside of them. They have been fully submerged under water many times and still work great! Will definitely order again.
positive,Great
positive,works great
positive,Cars running great now
negative,I purchased this cup holder and it was delivered with parts missing and broken. I returned it immediately.  My advice is do not buy it unless you don't mind being disappointed...
positive,"Super nice kit!! As soon as I install them, I'll update."
negative,"I can’t get a Tesla air filter to smell good longer than 4 months. I bought these hoping to get a year. Replaced them after 4 months with regular tesla filters because these smell like mildew feet. Not necessarily the filter’s fault, but it’s $34 for Tesla vs. $50 for aftermarket."
positive,quality product...very happy!
positive,Good wiper.
positive,Great fit on 825i gator with exception of main wires were too short! The mount and winch fit perfectly. Going to hardware store local buy a longer set of 8 gauge wire to run back to battery for main power boxes. I would gave them a 5 if the wires were long enough. Rocker switch does not For the gator punch out on the gator dash either.....Ordered one to fit it for 18.99.
positive,"These gloves are not bad at all, Saved my hands in a fall! Would recommend"
positive,Worked like a charm
negative,It says xxl but I have long hair and even with my hair down I can't get it past my forehead unfortunately. It's a great looking helmet but if you have dreads it will not work
positive,"I had to use two adjustable wrenches set to 1"" to tighten the two nuts to prevent water leakage.<br />Consider doing this before resorting to silicone rtv on it.<br /><br />Also, the hole needed to be 3/4"" (19mm)."
negative,Doesn't work for Acura TL Shawd like it said it would
positive,was no 100% correct bend but it did work<br />very difficult to install on 1980 jeep cj7<br />should have taken the pump off
negative,"I installed this feb 2020, now feb 2023 the wires are so brittle they are breaking.  I tried to remove the insulation on the wires to soldier the break and the wires are too brittle and just break.  The actual copper inside must be like 28g, it’s tiny tiny tiny.  Buy something with thicker actual wire, not just insulation.  I now have to rewire my trailer with something better."
positive,Shipped fast and had exactly the rings I needed for the job!
positive,Excellent
negative,Even letting the huge amount of foam set for the prescribe amount of time. Rinsing off car. Still dirty.  Doesn't work!!!  and has a 20% price crease for 2022
positive,Ordered a set of replacement handlebar clamps for a mini bike and these works perfectly.
negative,"1. these wired in reversed .... had to flip the plug 180 degrees to get it to work .. but then, the plug doesn't clip in ..  the only solution is to tape them together which will allow moisture an corrosion over time ...<br />2. my stock bulbs produce just about the same light as these..  definitely not worth the $.  Gonna look for more lumens."
negative,Falls off super easy
positive,When you install this you don't have to take out the mat make sure you raise the divider and get your front 4 screws tight or your tray won't slide back and forth I used power drill on them..then My tray slides normally
positive,A+
positive,"Sounds much better . More power ,less vibration than stock . You must use the hmf programmer because it will run too lean without it ."
positive,Great hitch !<br />Simple install on 2011 chevy express<br />1/2 ton
negative,workmanship on this thing looks terrible  you call it ac delco but looks like china crap to me  i hope this works and i wont know for a while because i am waiting for more parts
positive,works well
positive,"My '02 Mean Streak doesn't like to start when it's damp or misty out. Until I can figure it out I'm hoping this lightweight half-cover will keep the important parts dry when I'm camping or on the road.<br /><br />I have a large heavy duty Amazon brand cover that fits all the way over the bike and it works perfectly at home. It protects the bike from the sun and the rain, but it is too big to take with me when I'm traveling.<br /><br />This Autohaux XL packs down small and covers the seat and motor just as I had hoped. It even covers my sissy bar bag, keeping it dry too. It isn't heavy duty like my full cover and I never expected it to be. It will probably fade if I leave it out in the sun, and water may soak into the material in a heavy storm. That's fine, I knew what I was getting when I bought it.<br /><br />Think of it as a lightweight rain jacket as opposed to a heavy duty rain slicker. Toss it in your saddlebag and have it ready to go on quickly when the weather gets a little rough on the road."
positive,Was a relatively easy install and a well-made product
positive,"These plates are super sparkly, easy to install and they arrived quickly!"
negative,"These crosses are flimzy, very sticky on the top and hardle sticky on the bottom. They are all bunched up and looks like someone crumbled them in a ball.<br />They are dirty looking and no where near shiney like the pics show them to be.<br />Waste of money... DO NOT BUY"
positive,Muy bien gracias.
positive,"This stuff works great on the black malleable iron pipe I used it on, but it ran out very fast. I would've liked a little more for this price point. But still 5 stars for the product itself."
positive,Meguiar's makes excellent products all around and these towels are another one in my toolbox. Works well for buffing exterior and interior finishes. Came pretty lint free which is always a plus.
positive,great price. easy to installed. looks are great. fit was described
positive,thanks
positive,"nice product, thanks"
positive,"I picked this up for a car geek friend and he is in love. It's got wires and QR codes and an app, the ultimate techy car geek toy. Except it's not a toy. You get great info on your battery that helps you avoid a problem before you're stuck in that airport parking lot at 3am in the freezing rain. At this price point it is certainly not for everyone, but for a car enthusiast or RVer it is a great tool."
positive,"Fits well on my 2003 Honda Shadow 750 Ace Deluxe. Pretty well made. Seems very sturdy. Like someone else commented, back pad has thin wood inside to mount 2 screws to. Hopefully, they will stay secure or I may have to figure out another mounting option. Not like it really needs instructions to put together, but there wasn't any in the pkg. Overall, a superb deal for the money."
positive,This is the best fuel additive on the market. I will never fill up my tank without using this product.
positive,Perfect fit for my 2008 Navigator / easy installation / runs like new
positive,"A little work to put these seat covers in.  Very tight.  Looks very nice after they are installed.  I've had cheap seat covers in the past and they don't last or look nice.  Yes, you pay more for theses covers, but you get a lot more.  I like them a lot."
positive,"Limited application, I realized my boats stern came too close and the winch handle is too big so it hits my boat. Other than that, perfect!"
positive,Won’t let me upload two pictures to show the before and after. This has to be one of the best products I used. The bolt you see in the picture was completely stripped with barely any thread left. This product restored it back to its original shape within 5 minutes.
positive,Installation took just a few minutes and the replacement kit worked perfectly.
positive,"Great lights, plenty bright this kit has very good installation instructions. Easy to install, very good kit and well worth the money."
positive,it was just what I needed to replace the one that I broke.It fit perfectly and works just the way it needs .I will be buying more parts on Amazon seems how they are the cheapest around
positive,"We recently bought more cars, so garage is full and we are parking a couple of cars in the driveway.  I have purchased a few different full car covers as well as a couple of windshield shades at discounts to review, to find the best, most practical product for our needs.  A windshield shade is a must for our csrs parked outdoors that we drive more frequently and don't want a full car cover hassle.  We already owned a couple of the long, crinkly tin foil looking windhsield shades that are ugly at best and don't store very easily.  I bought this particular shade due to the description of lightweight and the fold up capability.  This shade is very convenient to use.  As with other windhsield shades, we need to fold down the driver and passenger mirrors to keep it in place, but this is zero issue for us.  The screen is indeed very lightweight and I can pop it in place and remove it in seconds.  Love that it folds back into inself for discreet, easy storage.  The shade absolutely does its job of keeping the car cooler on these hot summer days and even though it is thin, light material, it seems very durable.  The retail price point is very fair and we think this was a great buy!  We had bought it for a big Chevy Tahoe and it left several inches of windhield exposed, so we swapped it out to a Lexas Sedan and it is perfect.  You can double check your vehicles dimensions with a quick google search and compare it to the listing description to ensure a good fit."
positive,This pump was installed in a 1999 4.3l v6 Silverado.  The hardest part about changing the water pump is removing the fan. You need a special wrench. If you dont have one you will struggle a bit. Also make sure to clean the gasket area well. So far the pump has not leaked. Replaced the old one because it was leaking by the weep hole.
positive,Bought to hold fan pulley on dodge cummins engines. Works great
positive,"The tank/tote is inexpensive and that is why I purchased it.  I do not regret the purchase, but the instructions that came with it are for some other tank tote and do not at all relate to this product.<br />However, this tank tote is very basic and easy to figure out.<br />The orifice for cleaning it out has a cap that was a bit tough to  properly insert and twist/lock into the tank tote.<br />For what I need (rare use), it will suffice so I don't regret the purchase.<br /><br />The way the ""Owner's Manual"" does not relate to this item, but to a more sophisticated item, I wonder if the manual was accompanying this low end tote tank as an encouragement to upgrade to something more expensive."
positive,"Aero wipers have so far been the best quality wipers I have used yet. Very quiet operation, and they seem to lay better on the windshield, less tension as others I have used, which seems to help them be so quiet overall. Give them a try, I think you will find they both work well and good longevity."
positive,Product as described and arived in good condition
positive,They do not include a new nut and  is extremely hard to get out and easily dropped where you can't get to it Had to know the hardware store I buy you more
negative,Works
negative,"I had to trim the blade contacts a bit as they were too wide, and both bend them out as they were too close together, and twist them as they were too thin to hold themselves in place.  The fuses fit just fine in them, and in the fuse block, but these adapters needed to be modified to fit in the fuse block of my 2012 Chevrolet (site indicated that it was a correct fit).  I ended up tossing these and getting a correctly fitting adapter from NAPA (that strangely lists no Micro2 variants, and simply lists their adapter as Micro ATC/Micro ATO).<br /><br />I'm not sure if the failure is of the product being sized out of spec, or the listing / compatibility or description being incorrect."
positive,It’s like getting a soft cuddly kitten to sit on my shoulder. It completely eliminates the sharpness of the strap that we all have to deal with when we hook up our seatbelts. I look forward to it every time I get in the car.
positive,It really is a good idea to read the instruction. lol<br />An awesome knit that can be fine tuned simply to meet traffic requirements.
positive,"These mats fit perfect in my 2022 Chevrolet Colorado without having to trim them ! They are very nice quality floor mats, and look great. I love that you can remove the carpet from the mat when needed when you have dirty jobs to do."
positive,Easy to use and read
negative,Sent it back ...what a rip off... I thought it was the entire valve based on the price...way too much money for what you get.
negative,"Echoing what the other guys here have said. There is an interference problem with the wingnuts when tightening, and the bolts are not J shaped which makes them a challenge.<br /><br />However... It is made of metal... and with a little modification works well."
positive,"Simplistic, but effective"
positive,My main concern was whether it could be dimmed with a rheostat - it can.  No knowledge on the light's long term viability.
positive,Shouldn't have to buy another oil drain plug gasket again
positive,"Ordered these for my 96 Bronco full size. They came - sorta slow - and when I opened the first undamaged box I found a mounting tab broken off. I was pretty peeved to say the least and emailed the maker because the return instructions were unclear. They emailed back promptly and said to send photos of the box, damaged light, etc. They again responded promptly and shipped me out a whole new set. They appear to be of good quality and all the components (hardware, threading rods, etc.) matched up perfectly with the original Ford pieces, which made installation WAY EASIER AND FASTER as I was able to just keep the Ford stuff in place at certain places. They look great and do not get water in them like the old ones. They make the whole truck look five years newer because on mine they were yellowed, leaking, and the primary eye sore. I am now extremely pleased with both the product and the maker. They could have made me ship the old ones back, wait, then wait longer to get the new ones, but they just took care of it. These are a heck of a deal and I'm happy with the company!"
positive,Keeps groceries from rolling around in the back end.
negative,I expected to get a New Item Not a Returned One that had Problems.
positive,"The eight pieces Cylinder Car Tissues  are readily available by design, not cost effective & are by no means the softest. Convenience rules."
negative,My compartment has a CD player built in so this did not fit properly.
positive,Fits and seems to do the job.
positive,Fit great comes with Everything you need installed on a 2022 Nissan frontier pro 4X
positive,"I just put this on our 2006 Buick Ranier, and took a 1000 mile trip to FL.  I couldn't be happier.  It has just the right amount of softness.  The feel is not tacky, but gives a nice grip.  The finish is ""flat"" black and so it does not reflect sunlight into your eyes.  The directions mention having a third hand while installing, and that's good advice.  I had to call the wifey for help.  I installed it on a cool day, but maybe should have left it in the sun for a while to soften it up a bit.  Anyhow, I would certainly order the same one again, if need be.<br /><br />As an aside, the Buick has about the worst possible wheel.  Part of it is shiny smooth plastic that is cold in the winter, and sweats your hands in warm weather.  Just nasty.  This covering negates all the designer's blunders."
positive,They did what they're supposed to do and the price was right !
positive,Good brakes
positive,just good
positive,"I thought a few problems where happening due to the battery not having good voltage. Turns out, I need to take a look at some other stuff. Save money and check the battery with this thing vs getting a new one outright"
positive,Put these in my 2007 MDX and even though they look nice and work well the slide around pretty easy there's nothing on the bottom to keep them in place.
positive,Fit inside stock fuel line. Saved a lot of money and headache making a custom high pressure line
positive,Easy to install and fit my '74 Jeep CJ5.
positive,"Glad these were available.. Lol, don’t get confused like I did (there are different plugs, and different bulbs for the high and low beams)."
positive,Good fit great product I have put them on two trucks now 2017 and 2019
positive,Good
positive,"My family owns multiple ford trucks and the oem inserts have failed, these look and seem to be of better quality than what manufacturer put in the truck.  Ive bought many of these, almost got all trucks replaced as the oem ones fail."
negative,"Good price but the slender ones came off in Auto Car Wash and are gone  = disappointing.  The larger model for Behind the handle is fine.  To me, wasn't worth the price of buying...."
positive,Nothing
negative,"the fan barely blow air,  after 5 min the coming out air was 68F...  so it's a fancy bad quality fan.<br /><br />UPDATE:  attempt to return: seller sent a shipping label with address in CHINA at my expense.  Now it's a $32 paperweight."
positive,This is the perfect steering wheel for my 91 Camaro convertible. Perfect size for me. Looks great. Love driving with this new steering wheel. The leather work is top notch. Fast shipping too.
negative,"These might be okay for 1/4"" vacuum, windshield washer or other thin wall hose application, but they will not fit over common 1/4"" fuel injector hose; too small."
positive,I’m on the short side (5’2”) and although these are long they were very easy to cut to size with good fabric scissors. Easily adjusted to fit in the waist. The extra stretch panel in the legs make it a great fit as well. They are true to fit by the measurements of your thigh. Highly recommended
positive,This bolted right up to my Carry All 10x5.5 aluminum trailer.  Was one of the cheaper options on Amazon yet it was very sturdy and appears to be very well made.  For what it does I don't see how the higher priced unites could be any better.
positive,great price and arrived quickly as promised
positive,I have a 2018 Equinox and this cover fits perfectly! The side flaps tuck inside the front and drivers side doors and do not move when you open the door. The hooks to hold down the cover over the engine attach perfectly to the wheel spokes and the windshield has elastic that goes over the side mirrors. Best windshield cover i have ever owned.
positive,"Nice product , works really helps"
positive,I ordered these for my 2006 Ford F-350. They look amazing and at night they are not as dark as you think. One of my taillights came with the corner broken and I contacted them. I sent them the pictures they asked for and they sent me a new one right away. It took less than 5 minutes to install and it was super easy. I recommend these solely based on the customer service experience. 10 out of 10 would by again.
positive,Arived timely and work well.
positive,good
positive,This stuff is double the weight of the red 150 version. It’s a little thicker but way better. I’m bummed it’s no longer available.
positive,"Works great,  EASY to program"
positive,Good product bad English on instructions
positive,Made with good quality material.
positive,All the pieces you need to replace both wiper jets on a 2013 Ford Edge. No issues with product.
positive,love!
positive,Nice Kit
positive,Great coat rack for the car. Bought one for each car. Coats/suit jackets hang nicely and don't get wrinkled.
positive,"Gift for sibling, and she loves it."
positive,All was perfect.
positive,Perfect replacement
positive,Best wiper I have used thus far and half the price of the leading brands.
positive,"I thought I would get by with using this on my motorcycle.  Really tough by yourself if it is not a ratcheting type.  It's ok for what it is though.  All parts were there and were oiled. At first, seemed like the pliers would not fit, but you have to ""force"" them open wider.  After a little bit of doing that, they opened all the way."
positive,Sturdy!
positive,"Even though it didn't set a trouble code, this was the problem, the Mass Airflow Sensor.  This replacement was easy to install and solved the hesitation issue"
positive,"Looks great in my Jeep, everything was in great working order, I bought a few accessories to make it more useful to me, not a replacement for the old stock scissor jack but a useful tool when in a bind"
negative,"Works pretty well, except passenger side of the plastic is not holding on anything and sometimes feels like gonna pop out."
positive,"doesn't noticeably make reception too much better, but is a great short replacement for the stock antenna the car has"
positive,"Perfect fit for 2005 GMC Sierra 2500HD 6.0 with 71K miles on it. Not sure how long a coil is suppose to last but decided to change them out with new plugs and wires little smoother idle and dropped 200rpm when idling. These were made in Mexico if another country besides USA makes a difference. I prefer a USA made product, maybe the President will get more and more once USA companies to come back to America?"
positive,"It’s great ni issues works & plugs 🔌 as it should, no issues."
positive,"Sturdy product, easy to use and gets the job done."
positive,Great price!
positive,Strong stuff
positive,"This was totally necessary for a series of electronics installations in my car. I used it to hide wires, pry apart dash panels, etc, and all without any damage to the vehicle. I use to use flathead screwdrivers which were too sharp, and silicone baking utensils which were too soft. These are just right!"
positive,"I used to have a Matco pressure gauge that cost about $115. It broke within 6 months of owning it, and Matco refused to warranty it for free. Not wanting to buy another high dollar gauge, I picked this one up on a whim. The quality is great, especially for the price. Display comes on automatically when connected to a valve stem. Display is large enough and bright. And a better warranty than the tool truck brands! No complaints here. Can’t comment on long term reliability, but I’m sure this will last me a good while."
negative,It is what it is!
positive,Work great in my 2020 Toyota Corolla hatchback
positive,"for the price, it's awesome. I wouldn't recommend putting it on the outside of your car, but should work for just about anything else."
positive,"Nice, they have Velcro underneath so they won't slide any direction. They are a few inches short for Model Y 2021 because of the seat risers design change."
positive,Great find! Material is sturdy and does not look cheap. Classy.
positive,"I wanted to test this product and see if it’s up to the quality using a ceramic glass cleaner. It really does bead away the water on my windshield. I applied it in the shade on a warm day after washing and drying the windshield.  My car windshield is in real good condition like a new car without any road grime or highway nicks.<br /><br />It only takes a small amount applied to the sponge that was included. I left it on for about 5 minutes then wiped off with the microfiber towel. I have to mention it takes some time getting it to fully wipe off without leaving any smudges. I did the rear window also and only used a small part of the bottle to complete everything. I like this product but I have used other ceramic cleaners that also did a good job.  Although I have never had a glass coating that last more than a year, so I will wait and see."
positive,My daughter loves her new eye lashes for her car! they are just what she wanted to stand out from the croud
positive,Be protected against surges and spikes with this easy to use 50 Amp in-line device.  I use it for my travel trailer.
positive,"This is not a proportional controller. this works by applying voltage in the same set pattern over time, every time you activate the brake pedal. (whether slamming or touching lightly). That said, this is a simple, easy to use controller that just plain works."
positive,Worked great!
positive,Very functional
positive,"Just what I needed for my radiator flush, stock coolant."
positive,Works perfectly
positive,"I bought these for my new car so that the kids wouldn't get their feet all over my back seats (both were in booster seats so their kicking range was greatly extended). Not only have they protected my seats, but the kids love the many pockets that they can keep their stuff in. These fit well in my Mazda CX30. Only issue I have with them (reason for the 4 stars) is that I wish the bottom strap could be a bit more snug and allow for the middle part of the organizer to fit more securely against the seat."
positive,Went right in on the wife's 200. Wife says they're better than the originals.
positive,great value for the price as a prop.
positive,Excellent product and price. I was surprised to see a metal impeller. Many aftermarket pumps use plastic.
positive,He’s just so cute! He makes me smile just looking at him! The scent doesn’t last long but that’s not what I bought it for anyways!
positive,"Looks great, feels great. It is a kind of thick but I think I will get used to it. Will be great in the winter with gloves on. Overall it has a better feel than the OEM steering wheel which started to disintegrate. No smell like others reported and easy to install. Packaging was perfect."
positive,So pretty! 4 of all the Colors.
positive,This six pack is a good value. It works as well as any name brand. We've had no issues with it and it is convenient to have the six-pack on hand. good stuff.
positive,Gift for my son in law and he loves it! Very good quality but for the price it should be!!
negative,"This cover didn't fit my mid-size 4-door sedan, only extending to the tops of the bumpers.  The description said ""for cars up to 200"" and my car is less than 200.  I don't know if they sent the wrong size or not (size Large was marked on the box).  I didn't want to take the chance by exchanging it and getting the wrong size again, so I returned it.  The quality was not impressive either.  I was afraid it would rip by pulling it tighter."
negative,Do not fit properly.
positive,Love them but surprised they don't come with lug nuts for that price!
positive,Great
positive,"Works great. I got these for my wife's 2018 Pilot keys. These fit snuggly and don't add a lot of bulk to the key fob.  The material is grippy and they don't slip out of hand easily. Overall,  a solid product."
negative,"Part is not identical to original OEM -- part did not have a ground lug on it like the original OEM B&S part -- thus there was no way to stop the engine except to choke it to death with the chokeA - it makes a spark, but lacks this OEM feature for stopping the engine ..."
positive,"Husband Loves them, thanks!"
positive,Great just like any fel-pro product
positive,nice fit
positive,Very easy to use and the window damage is not visible.
negative,"This badge original look terrific and the quality is fairly good, but over time, car washing, etc. the red paint fades and now looks like a dark pink. Not good!"
positive,"My car's interior was looking a bit funky due to my lack of care. I went searching for a solution that was easy and recommended by others. After a little research I came upon these wipes. One treatment made my car door interior look like new and kept it looking like new for a good while, actually I haven't had to reply. Very happy about this purchase."
positive,worked as listed
positive,Good little low amp part.
positive,"I got this to help with fogging issues.  I hear many rave about the pinlock shield.  Do be advised that installation can be tricky.  Be sure to clean your hands...even the least amount of skin oil can leave fingerprints inside the visor...requiring you remove it to clean them off.  Also, carefully examine the pins your visor uses.  Mine were very small, and I needed up-close reader glasses to see that they weren't aligned properly...causing frustration with installation."
negative,"I have a Toyota Sequoia and because I had airbags I needed a cover that wouldn't cover the whole seat.  The straps to hold in place are pretty much useless and it kept sliding off.  If you have cloth seats this might work, but it definitely didn't fly with leather."
positive,Easy and really good
positive,Takes a while to fill up a tire but you get what you pay for. Well worth the money.
positive,These fit my old 2004 Saturn Ion RIP from hail storm.
negative,Seemed well constructed but the protective pad on the pinky finger was extremely uncomfortable verging on painful for me after 5 minutes of riding. Could have been a fit issue and might have gone away with more use but these gloves were unwearable for me.
negative,"Worked great for a couple of months, then quit working.  Great idea, inferior device."
positive,Best RV mattress you can buy for decent price!
positive,Really liked it once I got it on.  Work slowly.  It will eventually go on
positive,Very nice bow. Better than I expected and very high quality for the price.<br />Perfect gift for your teenager and even used as a pic accessory.
positive,EXCELLENT
positive,Wine was spilled on a beautiful soft leather purse and I didn't think the stains (dried in) would really come out.  This worked perfectly.  Came with the cloth too.  Followed directions and waited...looked like new.  Didn't even change the color of the bag.  Very happy.  5 stars.
positive,Looks great on my car.
positive,good
negative,"I do like the looks, however be aware that there a couple issues.<br />1. Both the front facing lights a keyed for the drivers side… this causes an install issue because on the passenger side it pulls the wiring harness tight, why this is an issue is because the prongs on the inside of the Chrysler designed connector are offset and pulling the wires moves them and the passenger lights will not work, I fixed this by adding some length to the harness. But it should not happen if they would have keyed each side…<br /><br />2. The front facing turn signals are not that bright when flashing.<br /><br />Still look cool even knowing to was a pain to fix an issue when there shouldn’t be one."
negative,"Armorall extreme is actually better at half the cost. They normally have pretty decent products, this IS NOT one of them"
positive,These were easy to install on my 2014 Venza LE.  They do a much better job then the factory bulbs. For my car I needed to buy some trim puller tools in order to get to where the bulbs were.
positive,I just wanted to confirm for anyone else with my car.  It does fit.  I was concerned about ordering from Amazon after I read some reviews on other products saying that Amazon had claimed it would fit and then it didn't.  Since this filter was so cheap I just figured it wouldn't be too much of a loss if it didn't fit and I bought it.  Thankfully it did fit though and I saved a few bucks compared to buying it from Grease Monkey.
positive,Amazing LED bulbs for my Mini Cooper. So bright and so much better for driving at night. Easy to install and at a great price. Can't go back to the old dim halogens anymore. The only downside it that my car computer warns me that my high and low beam bulbs are broken every time they turn on - just once. Apparently this is due to the LED using less electricity than the standard ones. I spent time tying to find a fix that would not damage the car and I have given up. It's not that important. These LED lights are amazing (low and high beam) and such a bargain!
positive,Fit great
positive,"It's excellent, My car looks beautiful and  that is I like it"
positive,"Put these in a 2010-2015 model Honda Pilot with the Rear Entertainment Package (RES). These things are AWESOME. The RES Pilot, and I presume the Touring Pilot as well, has a design flaw: When in reverse at night, the image for the rear view camera is dimmed. There is a manual override button, so it's not insurmountable, but by default, the image is inadequate for assisting in backing up. However, with the bad boys installed, even the astronauts on the International Space Station have a good view of what is behind my vehicle. You want to see what is behind your vehicle? You want to be extremely visible to others when backing out of a parking space? Then you want these lights."
positive,"I ordered this to get an idea when to stop moving forward in the garage. I wish I had ordered it earlier. I cleaned the ground with soap and water then let dry for a day. I placed the product on the ground, and it stuck immediately. The grip is very tight so try to get the placement right the first time. The product does not move as my wheel bumps against it. I just got the product, but it seems very sturdy, so I don't expect an issue. I would recommend this product"
positive,"I had been looking around at several sites for a way to store my Bestop NX soft top on my 2000 Wrangler.  I couldn’t justify the price from other brands but I am happily surprised by the quality and figment of this brand.  For all I know, this company may supply product for the other big companies.  The quality of the stitching is great, the bag and hang from a hook when full, and I don’t have to worry about the windows getting scratched.  Please be aware, if you have a two door like me, and you place this bag behind the front seats……it is impossible to have anyone in the rear bench.  I would recommend this bag to anyone with a Jeep TJ."
positive,Super solid fit and straight forward install.
positive,Fit well. Looks like it will hold up for another 20 years
positive,Excellent. Perfect fit
positive,Good backing plates for smaller polishing areas
negative,"I normally purchase the K&N brand of this filter element.  Comparing the K&N to this Fram, I can see that the K&N has more pleats (more pleats, more filtaration) and the Fram filter material appears to have fibers sticking out of it that seems a bit odd."
positive,I didn't realize that I needed to replace my air filter and change my oil until I put some old oil in my push mower and blew the spark plug right out of its socket because the oil had clogged the old filter and broke the &#34;metal&#34; side! omg - my son cleaned and changed the oil and the air filter and wow is my mower working great again!
negative,"I purchased this despite Amazon saying it would not fit because the product dimensions on the information page matched closely with the product dimensions that I had measured for my old filter.  In addition, some people said that it fit perfectly for them even though others did not.  Unfortunately the dimensions of the filter I received was 7-5/8 x 9x 1-3/16, while the old filter was 8-7/8 x 10x 1-1/8.  I have a 2016 Kia Optima which is the Kia verson of the Hyundia Sonata.  Basically the same.  I guess I trusted the wrong things... I should have followed Amazon's guidance, but have been steered wrong on that in the past, so just wasn't sure.  Oh well, live and learn.  Not sure I should try again with the one that supposedly fits because the product dimensions on that do not match either and some people say it fits while others do not.  Frustrating."
positive,These metal clips are great.  They hold the glasses firmly and don't break like the cheaper plastic models do after a few months.
positive,Keeps my windows clearer than the cheap wipers.
negative,"Very  poor  quality  and  fit, bottom  edge  sticks  out  a quarter  inch"
negative,"I really wanted to like this seat cover and wanted it to work.  This seat cover was so close to resolving the issue with my '19 Mazda MX-5 - but came up about 4 inches too short (*cough*).<br /><br />The seat cover actually looks respectable, build quality is decent, and blends reasonably with black leather seats.  But, here's the big problem:<br /><br />1. Seat cover is about 4 inches too short.  The intake fan sits on top of the seat, between your thighs.  It SHOULD be hanging in front of or below your seat to work intake air properly and for comfort.  My coupe has relatively standard length seats, and I sit mostly upright - so that's not the issue,<br /><br />2. Sliding the seat cover down so the intake fan sits properly means the middle and upper part of the pad sit too low.  Since the cover wasn't really meant to be positioned this way means restricted airflow to the upper part of the seat cover,<br /><br />Some miscellaneous nuisances:<br /><br />A. High/low on the in-line power switch seems to change fan speed.  Not such a big deal except,<br />B. The fan is very buzzy/noisy.  The only good part is it appears to be a standard 80mm PC 12V PC intake fan.  One could probably replace it with a better fan.<br /><br />Returning the seat cover for reasons 1 & 2 above, unfortunately."
positive,"This stuff helped out so much on my WRX 5 speed! I had done a stage 2 clutch on it. Used the Royal Purple at first. It did well for a while then i was getting some grinding shifting into 5th gear. I was at speed to shift. So people don't think i was shifting to soon. Replaced it with Redline oil. It did not like that either. Which I love Redline oil! Went with the Subaru transmission oil and it was worse,  way worse. Finally gave this a try. I did 3 quarts of this and the rest gear oil. Baammm! No more grinding. Shift are way better. Granted, I am putting 390whp and 479ftlb to the wheels. I know its only a matter of time. But at least for now, it helped"
positive,Direct replacement for my kawasaki voyager xii thanks
positive,"This is a Good set of Drivers, will not fit all seals but works well."
positive,Much better solution than the previous one I bought which was too flimsy. This one is sturdy and the wings tuck into the door to hold nicely.
positive,Fast delivery.  Easy to use - better than the cheapo I had been using.  It attaches very nicely to the value stem.  I've had a few times where I was getting false readings.  But overall I like it.
positive,"Compact size so it is not obtrusive in the home.<br />My husband tested this box to see if it works as a faraday box should, and it does!<br />Pretty cool.<br />The lock is difficult to open, so we learned that we don’t have to actually close the lock all the way for it to be affective."
positive,On time and worked great
positive,The price was right and the quality even better.
negative,I think my wife used these once. Theyre janky to say the least but I guess they do block the sun...
positive,Used this on my 2019 Polaris Ranger 1000 XP. Went on easily after removing the front bumper. Very robust in it's materials and should serve me well as long as the machine is in use.
positive,A little hard to get to stick but once they do they are fantastic!! And I can still see out the window well enough to drive.
positive,"The product is good, but they are a pain in the a@@ trying to put on. I suppose once you know how, it would be fine, but the instructions and the design makes it challenging. Now they are on I really like them, but I don't think I'll buy them again as I have bought others that take 20 seconds to put on!"
negative,Led to believe by MOPAR that this would work on a 2015 JK two door. The back mats are for a four door. Cost thirty dollars to return. Not that the quality of the product was bad. It does not fit a 2-door.
positive,nice balance smooth ride cheap af
positive,I am tickled with my license plate. It is sturdy and beautiful. I'm glad I got it!
positive,3 years ... still holding air !!
positive,"It's summer and that means the kids are riding their bikes almost every day. Somehow, the tires always seem to lose air every few days. They don't like to pump their own tires and bug me a lot. I got this digital pump ski they can maintain their own bikes. You set the psi (35 psi for both bikes) and it will automatically stop when the tires are ready. No more excuses! Factory charge can probably last all summer. Love it."
positive,It is always smart to have a tool kit in the car for emergencies!
positive,Had it put in at a shop and it fit perfectly on my 2000 Chry 300M 😎👍🏽
negative,"Product is fine, only enough hardware to install 2 mud flaps. This error seems intentional since others have noted it too. No installation instructions."
negative,"This switch has two operating indicators, i’m Using it for a Hi/Low headlight switch.  It has been 90 days and the Low Beam indicator has already burned out!"
positive,nice and comfortable gloves. good for summer/spring/fall riding. They aren't really designed for winter riding.
positive,"I swear by these mats.  If you have kids, they are great as to keeping the carpet looking great!  Also they are made in the USA."
positive,This is very easy to use. And is keeping the lawn mower battery charged during the very cold Winters we are having here in Michigan. Works really well and it's easy to tell when it is working.
negative,This does not fit a 2008 dodge caravan. The bolt hole is not the correct size.
positive,Removed old right fan and burnt-out motor by jig-sawing off the old fan motor mount plastic supports -- so I was just left with the large hole that was the diameter of the outside of the old fan removed;  installed this fan with 8 heavy duty thick plastic tie-wraps to the back of old double-fan housing on right side; had to custom connect the wiring to the Camry -- works great;  blows a lot of air; relatively quiet  RB
negative,"It is very functional for what its use is, but... it can take several minutes to open it. The included key doesn't work very well.  Husband usually can't get it to work. I would buy a different brand.<br /><br />Update. After the vendor read my review they contacted me and sent a new one. Works well and easily.  As it was intended.  The original one must have been defective.  They did NOT ask me to change my review....  now very easy to use!"
positive,Fits great and looks cool!
positive,Great Kit for the Money!!
positive,"First, the blades work well. But i have a question. Why is it that there isn’t a generic wiper blade connection? Windshield wipers were invented 120 years ago! So you buy expensive OEM blades or you need to buy blades that come with adapter kits to connect to the specific wiper arm that your car maker has chosen. No criticism of these Trico blades which come with sparse picture instructions to switch the adapter to fit your car. A minute of fiddling and you’re done. But the question remains… why no generic attachment after 120 years?"
positive,[[VIDEOID:d5536e7352e90dedb7bb0db076951d1b]] This is a pretty cool surge protector for a RV.  My neighbor and his brother in law or uncle have RVs and were excited for this gift.<br /><br />It’s good for surge protecting they say.  Keeps nicer control if the electricity I guess when plugged in at a camp ground<br /><br />Seems nice overall and I like the design
positive,Fits our old P500 5 gallon gas cans to enable using  the new EZ Pour spouts.  Thank you!
positive,"great product easy assembly, very sturdy"
positive,Awesome
positive,"Good quality product at a reasonable price, no complaints here."
positive,Gift to adopted daughter. She is very happy with them
negative,Recomended
positive,My Track Tacoma look like new I am really like this one product
positive,"works great, but if your rims are complicated or extra dirty, you might want to consider restraining the bristles but putting a wire tie around the bristles at whatever distance gives you the amount of firmness you need"
negative,After only 2 months the paint has severely chipped off. We do not live on a gravel road and don’t use automated carwashes so this is not a durable product.
positive,If you have a car with a coating that repels water just one of these will be plenty to dry your car. If you have no protection on your car you'll be able to get through drying it with two of these. They're decent sized and do a great job. This was the first time I had purchased a dedicated microfiber drying towel and I'm very satisfied with it.
positive,love this item
positive,Works as advertised. Really nice hitch lock for the money.
positive,The bumper sticker is hilarious! We have even had people leave notes on our car laughing because of this sticker.
negative,I thought I liked the product but it tore the second day I had it installed. After a drive I noticed one side had torne with the wind. I'm not a fast driver.
positive,works great for cab over camper
positive,Used it on a recent brake job with great success.
positive,Perfect for my bike
positive,"These work great in my campervan, no problems."
positive,Item constructed well and bright enough for its purpose: I use a pair for both front (in addtion to light bar) and rear spot beam (i.e. trailer hook-up)
negative,"Was delivered with puncture holes.  Something as fragile as a radiator should be packaged better than with cardboard and thin styrofoam.  Also, was not as pictured.  Came with an extra unnecessary stub up top that would have to be capped."
positive,"Extremely well built ramp for the money.  As stated in an earlier review, all welded connections.  Comes with safety straps so it doesn't kick off the tailgate.  For the money this is a sweet deal!"
negative,Get a can of spray paint and save your money<br />  Very cheap made !!
positive,Just what was needed. Fair price for good oil.
negative,"First up, these lights are very bright and installed easily. They look small, but have great output. That's the good. The bad is that I thought I ordered the ""soft white"" color (they call it warm white in then specs) and it looks like I got the ""super white"" shipped to me (hard to be sure, package has no indication of the model on it).<br /><br />Now, this could have been my error, but the light - while bright - is too harsh for inside my trailer. So, be careful what you order and what you get."
positive,"best one available!! very thick pipe and a 1/2 "" flange!!! will last forever!!!"
positive,Great value
negative,Had a terrible experience with these headlights I retired after 36 years as a mechanic and have seen and replaced a few in my time these headlights cast shadows that are very distracting to the driver and front seat passenger would not recommend nor would I ever purchase them again.
negative,"After 2 weeks of use, the top end by the cap melted from the heat. I just hope it won't leak now."
negative,"It's ok. It has the pockets and adjustable compartments, but what I struggle with is the Velcro on the bottom. I know it's purpose but I find I fight with it more than it's useful. When trying to move the bag around it constantly sticks and I mean STICKS to the carpeted flooring. I had to actually cover the Velcro with some packing tape for easier maneuvering."
positive,will buy again
positive,"Great product, works great"
positive,very well made and fast shipping
positive,"Good brand, good value!  I always use double iridium's now.  Anything less (platinum, copper) wears too quickly.  Any over (triple iridium) is an overkill."
positive,Ease of use and protects disability hang tag
positive,Worked well.
positive,Great product
positive,Same as OEM parts but half the price. Working well so far.
positive,Yes the instructions came with the latch and easy to install
positive,Has everything that a driver may need. The bag isn't too big and is easy to spot in the red case. It would be great if there were little velcro &#34;antislip&#34; pieces on the bottom so that you could make it stick to the inside of the trunk area without hearing it slide everywhere. It's too big to put under the seat but may be able to squeeze in near the spare tire if you car offers that much space.
positive,Perfect for our thomas the train ride on!! American plug.
positive,Very easy to use.
positive,"Perfect item to hang stuff on. Four was too much for me so I gave away two. Well made, was concerned if hooks would hold well. They do!"
positive,Keep that winch looking like brand new with a cover
positive,very good
positive,No enclosed installation instructions and the video wasn’t complete. Front to rear straps self explanitary. What to do and where to hook elastic side straps?
positive,"They recommended I go with the C3 size for my car.  My car is 190&#34; long, 73&#34; wide (without mirrors) and 55&#34; high.  A 2006 Pontiac GTO.  This cover fits exactly how I hoped.  It is snug and doesn't touch the ground.  It barely covers the front and rear bumpers, in fact my rear lower valence might have 1&#34; exposed.  But my last cover hung to the ground and I felt that picked up dust/dirt, even used inside the garage, so I wanted it just-right or slightly small.<br /><br />The elastic is also very strong,  much better than my last cover (was a Budge brand).  The material feels a little thicker/stronger and the grommets are nicer too.  Storage bag is nice.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy and we'll see how long it holds up.  The Budge lasted for years of indoor use before it started ripping."
negative,"The fit and finish of the product is outstanding. The problem is, LED aftermarket bulbs are severely dimmed to the point night driving isn't smart. So do I upgrade all 4 lights to an outrageously bright expensive bulb or take them off?"
positive,Awesome
positive,"It’s definitely a snug fit not loose at all ,<br />Took a minute to get it in but after that it’s great 👍🏼 to protect my wheel from sun damage or lotion or peeling!"
negative,the smell is ok however they last Only 2 days if that
positive,Compared to original and could find a difference.
positive,Fit my truck visor and gives me space to store things.
negative,I made sure my truck met all criteria for this light assembly...... but when it arrived I noticed the harness did not fit the 2018 Silverado Custom.
positive,worked perfect BUY with confidence
positive,"Much easier to instal springs with this tool, and it’s built to lasts"
positive,"Haven't really had to use, use it yet but I did test it out and gave it to the technition where I get my tires filled for free and he really liked it so that's a plus for me. One thing I do like is the configuration gives you a good, sturdy place to push against to get a tight seal and a good reading rather than it slipping off and you have to start again and again. It's easy to read and I hope it lasts a good long time as I think it will."
positive,May be one of the best car covers I have ever owned. Far superior to factory covers which I have gone through at least two of at a third of the cost.<br />The only concern at this time is will the shark fin antenna cause a problem down the road. I choose to fold a micro fiber towel and place it over the fin.
positive,The instructions say easier to install when warm. Laid out in Phoenix sun for 10 minutes. Made for very easy install. Very comfy. Would buy again.
positive,Perfect fit on my 86' F150 4X4.
negative,"I recently purchased these LED bulbs to replace the OEM bulbs in my F150.  After installation, the light was brighter and crisp compared to the OEM.  A noticeable improvement.  I have had the new LED bulbs for 5 months and one has already failed.  Disappointed in a failure so quickly as the LED technology is sold as premium technology that is meant to last."
positive,"Used to replace vapor seal on rear door of 2003 BMW 530i.  Its a known problem for E39's.  Worked well.  I had nearly 50% left over for another job.  The old sealer got on my hands and it a bear to get off.  The backing tape of the new sealer makes the installation job much cleaner than the removal job.  4 star, only because I have nothing to compare it to."
positive,Perfect
positive,Excellent quality
positive,Easy to replace
positive,"I was very happy with this product... I had returned the other brand gasket back to Amazon because it was not even close to 1/4&#34;.  I really needed a little over 7 feet as was in the returned item, but I didn't want to order two bags of this one... I though I'd be cheap and reuse parts of the old material that were still in great shape...<br />Anyway, I was PLEASANTLY surprised to find the cord was well over 6ft, and at least an inch or two more than I needed for a complete replacement of both window gaskets on my fireplace doors.<br />Cuts and installs easily... Cemented just fine.. No problems."
positive,"Nice quality item, adds a great deal of comfort in our Subaru."
negative,I got it for a friend he never even said thanks
positive,"Easy to use, used others and they weren’t as convenient"
positive,this spacer is simple and straight forward. i needed it to give a little room for my brake calipers not to rub on the wheel. success! ill report back when i know if the spacer helps with the rubbing in the front at all.
positive,"I had previously order a pump for my car. It constantly got hit and it wouldn’t go pass 30. Well, now I have this one. Wow, what a difference. My tire had 27 pounds of pressure. The sucker pumped it up to 36 in less then 3 minutes. It didn’t get hot at all. I’m extremely happy with it. This is definitely a must have for any emergency."
positive,"This works great, is easy to use and has more than paid for itself.  Highly recommend.  No more paying out all that money to dealerships to put vehicles on ""the machine""..... We have saved hundreds of dollars already using this device not to mention how much time, energy and gas."
positive,"This is magic product. I had a leak in evaporator of my 01 Subaru Outback. They wanted $700 to repair it. I never wanted to spend so much money so I started to look for alternatives. First I bought and tried Interdynamics AC Stop Leak, and filled with big can of refrigerant and it worked!....for two days. In two days I was sweating again.<br />I found this product and read positive reviews about it and gave it a try.<br />I followed the directions and added small can of refrigerant this time, and let the car run for 15 minutes. In first minutes I felt the AC was getting cooler, but when I checked after 15 minutes it was blowing hot. I was very disappointed since I was about to take 200 miles trip. So later after I started to drive, for 2-3 minutes I heard clicking noises behind glovebox, and with each click the car kinda shook a bit. I started to worry and when the noise stopped, I tried AC and it worked! It's been working for month and a half now and the refrigerant pressure is in normal range!<br />However occasionally I hear some weird noises from behind of glovebox. But as long as my AC works and I did not have to spend $700 I am happy with those noises! They remind me of this great product that saved me so much money.<br /><br />Update: It's been 4 months and A/C still works excellent. Very happy!<br />Update September 2016: AC is still ice cold"
negative,"I bought the green Bio pack before, and it's good stuff.  This product has no smell, it looks blue, as if in chem lab.  And it's not ""green"".  Spend couple of bucks more and get a pleasantly smelling green bio pack, it's worth the extra, and good for the planet."
positive,Perfect fit
positive,"The best from a great company,and you cant beat the price,works great,well made."
negative,I used these for about two months but it recently broke in a snow storm. Will not be buying again. Overall it did not keep the frost off very well anyway.
positive,"Been using this product for 16 years with very good results, but now have to add ethinaol (sp?) inhibitor for the small engines (Pressure washer, chain saw, etc.) that is not used regularly."
positive,This item fit well and came with all new bulbs and weatherproof gasket! BUY THIS NOW!
positive,Helps night driving immensely.
positive,The message is easy to read.  The reason for only 4 stars is that the letters are stick-ons and may not last long because of the commercial car wash it will be submitted to weekly.  To be determined later.
negative,i ordered two of them and one came with a hole in it and the other one worked great.
positive,Excelente
positive,This replacement skylight came with the mounting holes predrilled which made installation very simple. No cracks around the holes after installation unlike the original.
negative,"I threw one of these on my '12 Si sedan in hopes of a little bit of a power bump and THOUGHT I'd found the ticket.  It unleashes a real snarl.  Sadly, as I started paying attention to my intake air temps (via datalogging), I found that the K&N is a real letdown in the heat soak department.  At cruise on the highway, I find my intake air temps running anywhere from 16-18 degrees above outside air temps.  The second you slow to a stop, the temps go through the roof, as the K&N sucks in air from very near the heat of the Si's downpipe.  I'll be replacing it with a true cold air intake at first opportunity."
negative,"The gasket fits fine around the GM transmission.<br />However, the rubber rings around the neck of the filter do not come off.<br />When I pulled out the previous fluid filter, the rings stayed in the transmission because it was stuck.<br />I tried my best to get it out but could not.<br />Because the rings do not come off the filter, I was unable to use it and had to reuse the one already in the transmission.<br />The filter looks fine and would have fit fine.<br />Just be careful if you plan on doing a fluid flush since you might not be able to get the new filter into its spot.<br /><br />Quick shipping, and quality seems good."
negative,Poor quality and very bulky had to pay to ship it back a hefty fee
positive,Fits perfectly
negative,"Easy install and lots of videos on YouTube did by myself in the driveway. The truck looks great... One thing I will say is that if you truly want to maintain your factory ride you absolutely need radius arm drop brackets which this kit did not include!! I wish I would have bought the rough country 3"" leveling kit with the drop brackets included to maintain the proper caster angle. I would have saved more money in the long run."
positive,"This is probably my favorite sun shade of all time. Can't help but smile every time I see it. It is a pain to try and fold up, but perhaps it just takes a knack and a bit more patience that what I have. Otherwise it works as expected."
negative,"Absolutely never again. We needed this for a 21 hour trip, 8 hours from our destination we ran into some rain. Every last damn thing for my family of 6 is soaked. Stuff is ruined! It is just raining, not flooding. I will be asking for a refund."
positive,"I can't believe how stable this thing is. The Baxley truly is the Cadillac of bike stands. Very easy to use. I can ride my Hayabusa right into the garage, and easily push it back off in the morning. I use this thing every day and am VERY happy with the product. I've had it for a couple of months and the other day I was carrying a big container through the garage and missed a step - I backed right into my Hyabusa so hard that there is no way it wouldn't have fallen over (towards the kick stand side) if it wouldn't have been on the Baxley. Personal experience: it's very stable.<br /><br />It's also super convenient for using my pit bull stand to lift the rear end for chain maintenance, cleaning, and other basic bike care."
negative,"The good is that it fit easily on my 2008 Camry, made it look more interesting and was very quick and simple to install (and remove!). I'd say easier than other covers I've tried. If you want a cover that gives a lot of GRIP, this is definitely it, however I personally did not like the feel very much.<br />It is somehow too grippy for me, in as much as it seems your hands almost stick to it. This is great for tactile control of the wheel, but when you release the wheel after a turn and let it straighten itself out, the highly rubberized material sort of tries to take your skin with it. It feels almost like rubbing your hand against a tire. Some people might like this amount of grip, but I like feeling the wheel slide under my fingers when I release it, and I just can't seem to get used to the feeling that I have to actually remove my hands from it completely. I removed it from my car- I think it is a well made product, just not for me."
positive,"Product just as described- a heavy duty bed mat.  Fit & finish very nice for the Tacoma short bed truck.  Totally appreciate the accurate information provided on this product, which answered the important points needed for purchase."
positive,"Loved it. Looks great, perfect fit"
positive,"Our 19 foot Airstream travel trailer needs 30 Amp cable for shore power.  Over time, the shore-side (male) factory plug separated from our power cable, creating an electrical hazard.  I looked around at the local hardware stores for a replacement plug, but couldn't find one.  I was about to play a heap of money for a new cable, but then I thought of Amazon, and found this Camco plug.  After making sure that the amperage and number of prongs matched my old plug, I ordered this Camco 55283 replacement male plug with Amazon Prime.  When it arrived a few days later, I followed the enclosed diagrams and instructions to: 1) remove the correct length of outermost insulation from the cable, 2) remove the correct length of insulation from each of the 3 wires inside the cable (be careful, they are different!), and 3) attach each wire to its appropriate plug.  In a few minutes, I had a better-than-new power cable for my Airstream."
negative,Description said it worked for the 370Z.  Not even close.  Wrong angles and hole sizes.
positive,"If you have new LED headlights that have the polarity reversed, these work great for correcting the issue. The pins are very easy to change around and you wont have to mess with your factory wiring harness."
positive,Strange concoction. not exactly like other dry wax I've used. It leaves a nice shine and repels nicely. Not a big fan of the smell but it is not bad just not a car smell. Will give it more time to decide.
positive,Worked perfectly. No leaks. I did rivet it on like the original. Don’t forget to replace the oil cooler block off plate gasket while you’re at it because it probably leaks too. Also don’t forget the RTV in the corners on the engine block.
positive,Good quality
positive,"My son added headers to his 1975 Chevy Nova, and he need this part to get his automatic transmission hooked up properly.  He says it was pretty easy to do, and this works exactly like it is supposed to."
positive,Good Graphics and easy install.  Will have to see how long the graphics last.
positive,Fit perfectly on our Town & Country minivan 2014.  Very easy to install.
negative,The blue background is much lighter than shown.  I admit disappointment that the seller didn't make clear that their design would not sport accurate national colours.
positive,Worked perfectly.  Has stayed on the window and hot and cold weather.  Definite buy.
negative,Product is of poor quality. The graphics were also a bit blurry. I”ve had it on my truck for about two weeks and you can see it’s already breaking down... cheaply made....look for a another dealer.
positive,"Looks nice, fits well."
positive,absolutely love it thank you
positive,Worked great
positive,Can't bet the price if you need a coolant reservoir. Plastic seems sturdy and no leaks
positive,VERY GOOD QUALITY AND HAS BULBS AND EVERYTHING. FITS GREAT. I WAS QUOTED TWICE THE AMOUNT FOR ONLY ONE LIGHT. THESE CAMES AS A PAIR !!!! GREAT BUY !!!
positive,good BUY
negative,Product is great but customer service is not so much.
positive,"This stuff was recommended to me,  and now after seeing its value,  I am recommending to you.  good stuff."
positive,Excellent Item with a very prompt delivery
positive,"Very light weight. Maybe better for motorcycles. I used it in winter riding four wheeler. It did the trick, but I needed more warmth. They were fine for what it is."
positive,"Great price, installed easily, works great!"
positive,Just as described
positive,"Amazon wasn’t sure if it would fit my 2009 Lancer. It did. Took 5 seconds to install, works perfectly."
positive,Excelente
positive,Works well.  No odor.  Just drop and forget.  It will do the rest as advertised.
positive,Love it
negative,[[VIDEOID:160b6f5007efb6848d665f1d021dc338]] I LOVE this step EXCEPT the rubber bumpers keep falling off when you get on and off the step. When they do they start to dig into the side of the tire. I'm afraid they'll puncture or damage the sidewalls on my $250.00 dollar tires. So I get around this problem by screwing the bumpers all the way down to the frame and checking them EVERY TIME before I get on the step. Other than that I LOVE this step. It's a MUST when working on the trucks engine bay.
positive,"100% what I saw in the videos and expected. It works well, very straight forward device. ,. . . ."
negative,Part is fine minus one blemish. But.. Be careful of Amazon's part selection by vehicle tool. I didn't read description fully but Amazon said this part was correct for my 2008 ford f150. Not so - it might fit the tailgate but is not a match for front grill. Wasted money. If you open the package you cannot return the product. Oh well.
positive,"Easy to use, longevity is great."
positive,Running good
positive,"Ram Tough, LOL"
negative,"Color slightly darker for 2019 tacoma cement grey. Sprays flat and easy to spray, quality of paint only time will tell?"
positive,work well on my Kubota.  The brackets to clamp them to the ROPS were more expensive.  The wires were not long enough to reach from the battery.  Super easy install.<br /><br />They are cheap enough I might put a pair on the zero turn.  Why not?
negative,I don't know what I was thinking. The problem I have with this Tire Monitor is that I have to pull out my phone every time I want to see the tire pressure. Most of the time &#34;I do not&#34;.
negative,Doesn’t stick!!!
positive,Great oriface filter. Fit perfect.
positive,Installed in under 5 minutes.
positive,Worked great!
negative,"I would say that these are mid level brakes.. They will get the job done, just maybe not as fast as other better brakes.  If you are looking for a mid level brake pad, this will do the job great.  Don't be fooled by the look to thinking this brake pad is higher quality than it is.  But for the dollar, works great."
negative,"Did not fit 1994 Corolla 1.6L manual, center shaft is too wide to fit between bracket, missing rubber sound deadening ears, and top bracket welded poorly and was bent to one side. Very cheaply made"
positive,"nicely made, nice tint to it. no complaints. works well for my helmet."
positive,"My usual mechanic wanted to charge me $900 to replace this part. Ford says tbis is less than a two hour job. So, i found one of tbose teaveling mechanics in local classifieds and he changed it for $180 within two hours."
positive,"I was skeptical that this little  air compressor would be able to inflate my cars tires. The compressor is only a little larger than a soda can, and doesn't seem like it should be able to have enough power to get the job done. I was able to inflate two tires on my car to 32 PSI without any issues. When I was done, the tube was pretty hot, and the battery indicator was flashing low (after being charged to full), but the tires were definitely inflated to the desired pressure! This would be really good for inflating bike tires, balls, and other inflatables too. Also, definitely good to have in the car for emergency use on any long road trips. The light on the top to help use this in the dark is a very nice touch as well!"
positive,I like a heavier gear oil in my harley. Works great
negative,"The pad itself does it's job well, but, taking it off the Griot's Garage DA orbiter cause the backing to peal away from the pad rendering it worthless to use again.  The only thing I can use it for now is to apply wax by hand, which I could do with a much less expensive pad."
negative,"I bought this to replace the filter on my 2103 Acura TL and I could tell right away the airflow level went down quite a bit.<br />Doing a side by side comparison with a new OEM 80292-SHJ-A41 filter it was really obvious. I'm not sure if that would affect the life of the AC unit in the car but I don't like having to turn up the fan higher just to get the same airflow as before.<br />It's not a bad filter but it's definitely more restrictive than an OEM filter from Honda. And yes, I had the arrow facing the right way."
negative,Looks good but pricing for single piece is over priced Autozone has it for 5.99 free shipping and buying two units kept it within the normal range.<br /><br />Quality is normal and shipping was fast but price structure makes it a 3 star rating.
positive,I like it just wish it had a strap for storage.
positive,Perfect.<br />Bought these with the Bosch rotors.
positive,"This Clore ES2500 Booster Pac 900 Peak Amp 12V Jump Starter is much more than just a jump for your vehicle's low or dead battery. I quickly found out  that there are three main functions that this 12V battery is useful for.<br /><br />1.) JUMP STARTER- So easy to carry with it's handle and lightweight- you can take it wherever you need it. The Hot Jaw Clamps are strong, heavy duty industrial grade to give you perfect power transfer to your battery in seconds, leaving plenty of power for more jumps or other uses. It is so simple to use- you simply clamp the positive red clamp to the positive terminal on the vehicle battery and clamp the negative black clamp to the vehicle frame to ground it, then turn the vehicle's key. The automatic charging makes certain you will never overcharge. The LED Power Level Lights let you see exactly how much battery life you have left and when it is fully charged, the Charge Complete light comes on. Jumping your vehicle has never been so simple.<br /><br />2.) MEMORY SAVER- When you are changing your vehicle's battery from a dead one to a new one, you always lose your vehicle's memory- such as alarm system, computer, radio, phone, clock etc.- but you can save it all with this Booster Pac and the purchase of the ESA30 Vehicle Memory Saver Connector. This ESA30 Connector only costs around $12.00 here on Amazon and it works perfectly. You simply plug the wide end to your vehicle's OBD II Port and the other 12V Plug end into this Booster Pac's DC Outlet before removing the old dead battery and your vehicle's memory will be saved. After the new battery is installed, make sure your vehicle's memory is all there before disconnecting the ESA30 Connector from the OBD II Port. The ESA30 Connector even has an LED that tells you that a proper connection has been made to your vehicle's OBD II Port, so you'll know that your memory will be saved. Saving your vehicle's memory for $12.00 is a huge money saver over going to a repair shop to get your lost memory back.<br /><br />3.) POWER OUTAGES- This Booster Pac is a portable power source for any 12Vdc accessories with a male 12 volt plug. I have small portable tv's with this 12 volt plug, as well as portable lights and cell phones. In any emergency, I can have light, my phone and tv to stay informed. The DC Outlet on this Booster Pac has automatic overload protection, so my emergency tv, lights, phone and Booster Pac will all stay perfect. It's great to have my little 12 volt plug appliances plugged into this power source in an emergency, but I found that I can get even more power and use more than one appliance at a time, by purchasing a DC to AC Power Inverter. You can buy many different inverters that range in price from $30.00 and up, depending on what your use is for. Bestek makes a lot of good ones, and some have both AC outlets and USB ports which are perfect for small appliances- tv's, lights and with the USB ports, you can power laptops, cameras, dvd players and phones etc.. I've already used this Booster Pac and my Bestek Inverter to power a small tv, lamp and clock, as well as a laptop and phone in the USB ports. It even powers a small refrigerator- anything up to 300 watts maximum. This is wonderful to have an energy source in an emergency- even if only for some small basic necessities used off and on for a day or two.<br /><br />This ES2500 Booster Pac is so much more than a jump starter for your vehicle. For a few dollars more, you can have a memory saver by purchasing the ESA30 Vehicle Memory Saver Connector and you can have more AC outlets and USB ports by purchasing a DC to AC Power Inverter. The portable power this Clore ES2500 Booster Pac brings you is invaluable, affordable and definitely worth 5 STARS."
positive,These disc's work great
positive,Perfect 12v car charger. Exactly what I wanted.
positive,"I like this lock better than the previous lock I had. It works very well with ""Bulldog"" type hitches, which need about 2.5 inches of shaft. This one works a bit differently than most. Rather than simply a machined groove on the shaft, this shaft is threaded. The locking portion is a nut that threads on to the shaft. This allows you to tighten it down as far as you need for a tight fit. Remove the key  and the nut spins freely so it can't be removed. A great idea!"
positive,Love this product. easy to use and install and put away when not in use
positive,In Galatians 5:4
positive,Great bulbs. Super bright and provides a ton of light for field of view. Installation was easy. Ordered a pair of high beams too.
positive,This cleaner works very well it's worked on everything a spot on my headliner spilled coffee or soda in the cup holders just to wipe the armrest off it's really good cleaner.
positive,I got a great deal on this and couldn't be happier. It is a great product. Fits well. Good value. Great Brand. I recommend this purchase.
positive,"These things are bright! Great set of lights; I’ve had no issues so far but, we’ll see if anything changes as I continue to use them."
negative,"The reason I bought this sunshade, which is higher priced than many, is because it was supposed to be an exact fit for the model and year of my car.  The height is nearly exact, but the width is too long, and the cutout for the rearview mirror is overly large.  Also, the windshield visors are about all that keeps it in place, and even with them the sunshade is not flush with the window, but has a considerable gap between it an the glass.<br />It will surely block a light of light, though, but about anything could do that."
positive,"Awesome product.  I cant tell you for sure that it increased horsepower, but it is sure easier to clean."
positive,It is not OEM factory replacement but fits well and looks good. Original had raised letters but  this does not.
positive,"My son bought a Harley Iron 1200 and this fits it perfectly.  Like the orange lower as it keeps cars from backing into it . . . shows up great in the reverse camera.  Doesn't look like it will last more than a couple of seasons, but it is such a reasonable price we consider it a consumable."
negative,"The picture leads you to believe this is a BIG cover. It is not. Not even close. False advertisement. It sheds A LOT—it’s a nuisance but not a deal breaker. The item would have been four stars if they at lest sent me what I paid for, not a fuzz-deficit cover."
positive,Items arrived on time and packed well for shipping.  Perfect addition to my SUV.
positive,"This is as sturdy of a unit as a much more expensive one I've borrowed before. It worked great on my '99 GMC Sierra 1500 4X4. And it's my color, too!"
negative,"Coupled nicely to my grease gun hose, coupled nicely on to the Zerk fittings.  Problem is that the grease went everywhere except into the Zerk fittings.  I even tried it on Zerks that did not require a 90 degree coupler, still grease everywhere but in the Zerk fitting.  I had high hopes but I'll just have to look elsewhere."
positive,"Awesome product, holds up very well when the prep work is done correctly"
positive,Excellent product.
negative,I bought this straight from the range technology website and it never worked correctly. I even did a return and the replacement never worked either it. I wish I could get a refund I fill like I have been ripped off.
positive,"Everything included fits exactly correctly. The choice in materials makes cleanup so much easier than ""value"" products that won't come off of the type of plastic used.  If you are even slightly careful when using this, there's no chance you'll drip oil around.<br /><br />There are loads of places they could make small adjustments that would improve this product - but it's already priced around HALF of what you typically have to pay for something that's simply built right, so there's no complaint from me."
positive,works well
positive,"Dollar for dollar, this is a good buy. It arrives already assembled, except for the partitions, and is pretty sturdy. Because I use mine for groceries, I've divided it into just two large sections. Perfect! But, of course, you can use it for any other kind of shopping, such as school supplies, clothing, shoes, etc.<br /><br />However, you can also use it for emergency items (flashlight, blanket, flares, jumper cables, etc.) or for car-cleaning supplies. You can also use it for toys, books, etc. for the little ones when on a road trip.<br /><br />Its uses are pretty much endless; it just depends on your need. I'm very happy with mine. For the record, I own a Mercury Mariner (SUV) but formerly owned a four-door Saturn. It's works great in each.<br /><br />Bottom line: BUY it!"
positive,"I purchased these direct from the OEM as that was the only way I was able to get both the passenger and driver's side boxes keyed alike and installed them on a 2004 Dodge 3500 pickup. They're very easy to install if you're even slightly mechanically inclined, and have excellent utility as long as you don't overload them with too much heavy stuff, but I was led to believe they didn't extend past the wheel wells and that's inaccurate. That isn't normally a problem, but when I use my camper I have to pull them off the brackets and store them. If they did fit properly they'd obviously be inaccessible while the camper is in the truck bed, but since I drop off the camper at a campground and drive around with just the truck during most trips I'm losing a fair amount of utility from my purchase. The locks aren't really going to stop a determined thief, but they're enough to make snooping a little tougher and will add a few seconds if someone tries to steal anything (I am storing tiedown straps, diesel fuel stabilizer, a first aid kit, window wiper fluid, and miscellaneous small items inside that are easily replaceable but not cheap). Nevertheless, they're fully compatible with a tonneau cover, help eliminate clutter in the cabin, and overall are well worth keeping."
positive,"A couple of holes weren't aligned right, so I solved the problem with a drill. Love the security deck!"
positive,"Great to have over a bicycle pump, or dragging out the compressor and hoses for anything that needs inflating."
positive,"Our 2007 van has 244,000 miles on it and the original control arms were still on it.  The bushing end of the oems was actually in decent shape, but the ball joint end was worn and floppy.  Removing the old ones and installing these new ones was not a complicated process.  The castle nut for the ball joint end is tucked up in a tight spot but a ratchet with a short extension and a 19mm will get the nut off.  Moving the brake line out of the way was helpful, there was a small bracket with two 10 mm bolts and then another attach point with a 12 mm nut.  Getting the joint to pop loose was a little tough, there's not much space to try and hit the knuckle with a hammer.  I ended up borrowing a tie rod tool from advance auto and got them both out. When they let go the hub/brake rotor assembly is going to drop down so best to have a jack underneath.  To reinstall, I loosely attached the bushing end first.  To get the ball joint bolt to line up with the hole on the knuckle, I had to jack up the suspension a bit.  I found the best way was to put 2 lug nuts on the studs, and then I used my floor jack to push up on the lug nuts.<br />After replacing both upper and lower rear control arms on both sides, the rear end of the van does seem to move around less and seems to hold the road tighter."
positive,"After found that almost all supports available in Amazon.com had a little bit of complaints for different reasons, I decided to try this package because it had both supports at a great price. Expected these supports would be a little too strong and they were indeed. Front supports were easier to install but I had a little bit of struggle with the rear ones since they were about a half inch too long to fit snuggly. After installation, these over-powerful supports push the liftgate up a little over mechanical limit and it makes me a little concerned. Durability is another concern but time will tell."
positive,My husband bought on a whim but this is a nice kit. The light are magnetic and bright. We keep the kit in our car just in case and hope we never need them but if we do I know they will keep us safe by lightning up our car.
positive,Lasts a lot longer and works better than a rubber refill.
negative,It is slow and does not work as described. Not worth the money.
positive,Works great
positive,"Fit perfect , saved BIG $$$"
negative,"Its ok, I did not realize when I bought it there was no negative connection. I bought neg bar later and it works fine"
positive,Sturdy and just right for my car I bought it to store all of my hubby's baseball caps he's leave in back seat . It's suppose to be a car garbage can but my use for it was perfect great buy
positive,Worked great! Well worth the money.  Followed directions and went on very easy.  Matched my scion xb white paint perfectly. High quality material.  Would definitely recommend these.
negative,Very easy to program but the range on them isn't great. You have to be prettt close to lock and unlock it.
negative,"As others have noted, it has a very undesirable blue tint."
positive,Very easy to install.  Worked perfect on my 57 Belair.  Sounds awesome.
positive,Had them installed professionally months ago and work without a problem so far.<br /><br />2019 update; 2 years later the lights are working great no issues.
positive,"Good fit, works well"
positive,This is hands down one of the best investments I’ve made for my old 95 Silverado. I put in HALO lights a couple months back and I wanted something to really push it over the edge for my night driving.<br /><br />Half of it was being sick and tired of these high density lights killing my eyes on back roads at night from oncoming traffic. The other half is getting older and needs the extra distance.<br /><br />The install was simple enough. I wired mine off the back of the alternator as the connector was too small for my positive side of the battery.  Installation took all of 15 minutes at best.  If you don’t buy this you’re seriously missing out. Thank you guys!!!
positive,purchased as a gift
positive,Really good for the price and easy to install
positive,"It gets the job done. You can tell it’s not the exact model intended for the repair. It fits into place perfectly, just doesn’t operate the same as the original. Sometimes it sticks but just hit the button again and it’ll do what is needed."
positive,Form and fir meets OEM standards
positive,"Works well for thinner ice. Takes ice right off. Haven't had the chance to use this on thicker ice yet. Wear gloves when using it, as your hand is right there close to the ice."
negative,"i like the lights and the put out great light but I chose these as they claim to have the anti-flicker included in the light.  The low beams flicker on my 2015 Wrangler.  The solution from the seller was to tell me to buy the anti-flicker harness...  On the plus side, the return is free if I choose to just send them back."
positive,"Used as an interior locking device while in bedroom, worked nice"
positive,Fit my 2020 canyon .
positive,works as it should
positive,Good oil
positive,The sway bar kit made a big difference in the stability of the truck. Well worth the money. My Slash 4X4 can handle turns much better.
positive,"These are a bit pricey at regular price; however, I purchased 2 on Amazon Prime Days earlier this year and these are great.  I have the Chemical Guys buckets already so this is just what I needed!  I wash my new Dodge Ram 2500 at least once a week by hand so these help!"
positive,Good. Thanks
negative,"It's probably okay in a lighter colored car, but on black interior, a microfiber is better.<br /><br />It smears dust and leaves a trail.<br />Way too thick (the handle) to get near the windshield."
negative,More sides is not better. Found that out the hard way
positive,"Works perfectly on my 2017 Silverado LTZ.  I put the DIC in Relearn Mode, place the top of the antenna against the sidewall of the tire, about 2&#34; from the rim and centered over the valve stem, then move from tire to tire as the horn beeps.  Total time for a relearn?  Less than 30 seconds!"
positive,"The window looks like the window it replaced on my Roadtrek camper van, however it wasn’t an easy swap for my 2000 Roadtrek 190 Popular. It’s about half an inch bigger and required the installer to grind out the window space so it would fit. The windows look good. Just like the originals. Pricey, but with no other options for replacement, it’s worth it."
negative,"Average -- but nice. We used INSIDE our kitchen garbage can, hoping to take some odor away. A tough job. Didn't work as well as we had hoped, but still pretty good. (if you found this helpful, please click where noted below, and thanks!)"
positive,I used this on my pulley clothesline and it works perfect. I only hope that over time it will hold up under the varying outdoor temps and conditions.
positive,Works great
positive,Very cute!
positive,Works well for camping.
positive,They work
positive,Great value and great service
positive,"just as described, amazingly fast shipping!!!"
negative,This liner is slightly off if you are ordering for a 2012 Kia Sportage EX.  Not sure if it is because it's a second and these are the WeatherTech rejected items or what but being slightly off makes if it horrible.  Request return of item.
positive,Very sturdy .... keeps the car cooler than if not used... super cute too
positive,"what more can I say.  I don't know if they are any cheaper than the dealer,  but Amazon delivers and closest dealer is a 40 mile round trip.  I always buy 3 at a time"
positive,I was really tired of chasing the contents of my bags around the back seat of my car. These have solved that problem completely. I use one hook for my tote (that isn't light) and the other for lunch bags or whatever else I happen to be hauling around. I am very happy with my purchase.
negative,"item FAILED just after warranty period and cost me a second new battery because I was thinking the item worked as it should when in fact it was not producing and drained my first new battery, now that the item has failed completely I have to buy a second battery....  the old adage definitely applies here that; you get what you pay for!!!  skip this seller and buy a name brand and save yourself money in the long run!!!"
negative,"Does not fit coupe.  I did not return it as it took me way more effort to remove the old one and try to get this one to fit than the part was worth.  Totally useless for my application, description is completely wrong.  My friend has the sedan, out of curiosity I tried it on there, it fit.  Due to the poor quality of the material we immediately put his stock liner back in.  Bottom line, this product does not fit the coupe as listed.  Useless to me, waste of money."
positive,Nice… works great.  It is what it is.
positive,Bought for husband who used to get garage and work grime off hands. Gentle  in skin but effective cleaner for grime.
negative,"Product seems great, however the seller listed it for the wrong motorcycle so I could not fit my bike"
positive,"The price is right for these and I recommend them. They do have a smell that is made to be somewhat flowery, but it's there. It disappears after a month. If you don't want to mortgage your house for auto floor mats, these are for you!"
positive,"I ordered front and back mudguards, as well as new panel clips. The Husky Liners came with screw-in fittings but the push-in panel clips (identical to the factory clips) made the installation super-fast. It took less than an hour to remove all four old mudguards, clean the panels, and install the new mudguards. And they look like Toyota factory mudguards."
positive,Excellent Product
negative,"I drive a 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 standard cab pickup truck. I purchased these to replace some worn out  covers I've had for about 8 years. I'm not terribly happy with these. When I first opened the package, I thought they sent only one cover. It felt thick, but I realized the two covers were shipped nested inside one another. Once I separated them is when I noticed how thin the material actually is. Nothing tough or durable feeling about it at all. I ended up putting both seat covers on my driver side seat since I'm a landscaper and tend to be rough getting in and out of the truck sometimes. The integral  &#34;strap&#34; that goes around the seat and is supposed to keep the cover in place is a joke. Not nearly long enough to actually use it. Ultimately... these are inexpensive seat covers compared to most, so I didn't expect Kevlar level protection. Disappointed nonetheless.<br /><br />I would recommend that if you are looking at these for your truck.. keep looking and spend a few more dollars to get something more substantial. I'll be doing that soon."
positive,"Leopard Black Diamond tissue (or mask) holder is very pretty. I am not much for bling or flare, but this still managed to capture my attention. It's pretty, without being obnoxious. I like the way it looks, and the material is durable- doesnt feel thin and cheap. Attaches to visor via the tension clips. I have built in mirrors on both my visors, and this was able to slip over one no problem. Could also be attached to a storage box.<br /><br />I put it in my Jeep right away, so any off gassing went unnoticed."
positive,if you have a chevy 350 with a cracked starter bolt hole...this may help with that starter bolt staying in place. you have to use a brace too and pray it works.
positive,Worked very well to create these door panels to hold in place on the metal. Super easy to use and priced excellent
positive,"Works like a charm and, contrary to many You Tube videos, you DO need this tool."
positive,As described
positive,This works great to power by plug-in hybrid.
positive,"I replaced my my downstream o2s on my 14 mustang and they work flawlessly , they are great quality and look almost better than the motorcraft, i hope they last some time"
positive,Works great
positive,This is going to be great for my daughter when the baby comes - This will help the baby getting too hot and the sun burning down on her.
negative,Piece of crap. Don't buy
positive,"I got this for my JKU. I bought it used so the price I felt was more reasonable. My time is limited these days and I did not want to make my own roll.<br />This works great with the 2013 JKU windows. They fit perfectly.<br />It rolls up neatly. And all the windows are well protected.<br />Overall, worth the convenience."
positive,"Smells awesome just wish it lasted longer, but pairing this with a spray air freshener will help it last longer and smell amazing."
negative,Junk
positive,Perfect fit in my son's 2007 Corolla
positive,Fit perfectly and looks awesome. 1997 Toyota 4runner 3.4L
positive,I'm not sure how durable the seat covers are. Just got them. I love purple. When I saw them on Amazon...wow...had to get them for my RAV4.  They are really pretty and I love the steering wheel cover and seatbelts covers.
negative,"When finished it looks great. However, the outer screw hole on the passenger side needed to be widened (longated) 1/4"" to align with my 2018 Suburban hood."
positive,Costs plenty- check competitor prices in chain stores.
positive,Good value for the cost. Should be good to go for lightweight towing.
negative,Did not fit my 2017 BMW X1
positive,This is very attractive and durable
positive,"Because of a mold problem in the house we are currently living in our camper in the front yard, this gets used weekly to empty both the black and the grey tanks and has held up wonderfully over the last 3 months no complaints at all"
positive,These are great and fit well
positive,"Installed this on a 2007 Chrysler Town and Country, was quick and easy to do so.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the instructions tell you to remove the one exhaust hanger from the mufflers... and it took me a bit to realize there are actually TWO hangers!  Other than that it was a quick and easy job to do."
positive,"When your car won't start, this is a great tool to have next to your jumpstarter!  Now I'll know if I need to replace the battery or not every time..."
positive,They threaded on nicely and look good on my tires.
positive,This is amazing! literally gets the job done getting rid of dirt in my car. It even has a nice smell to it. It keeps the car from collecting dust all the time.
positive,Delivered quickly & the part was exactly as describe. A perfect transaction from beginning to end.
positive,Served its purpose.  Very happy
positive,looks better than the picture arrived on time very pleased
positive,Thank you
negative,Product itself was good quality. Unfortunately it was the wrong gasket for my vehicle. Something I wasn't aware of until I was in the replacement process. The selection process missed an important element &#34;:gasket with or without a tab for a notch&#34;.
positive,5000 miles having pulled my trailer and no crashes.  All is well!
positive,"A simple solution to a common problem; I have already used it many times, even where the slot was not required."
positive,"Product was so comfortable, not too hard or soft.  Good enough that I purchased two more."
positive,Fit fine and easy to install.
positive,If you like to advertise your zombie passion get this decal. Its well made and fun. I am going to buy another.
positive,"good fit, good price"
positive,"Cleaned wax build up off pretty good, I will buy more."
positive,Worked great
positive,"Wish it was a bit cheaper. But, I like it."
positive,Good quality wipers. :D
negative,kinda cheapy
positive,"Looks and works just like the oem. Installing is a pain, but is doable with the right tools. FYI, get the socket that is advertised along with the oil pressure sensors. The installation is almost impossible without it."
positive,"Was told the short version would work with my car along with the base listed as commonly bought together by Amazon. Was sadly mistaken, but now this rod is carrying a wonderful current to produce lovely signals from my radio."
positive,does it job and stops the car when you want it....<br />Fit perfectly
positive,"Great product, well made, durable - the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because a couple of the bolts they provided were too small.  It wasn't a big deal though I just had to stop by the hardware store and get the correct bolts."
positive,"I did have to change the top section - how it attaches as my car does not have a roof rack, but I wanted one like this that attached to my car as I load up my trunk and like to head out for a weekend at nearby campgrounds when the weather is nice.  I did have a regular tent, but I hated that it was separate from my car - where I have all my stuff!  So I took a chance on this one and it works.  May not work as well as if I had an SUV or mini-van, but I had no trouble attaching the bottom section to my tires and with the top section, I have those weather guards on all four of my car's windows - y'know, the ones that allow you to keep your windows cracked when it's raining without rain getting in the car.  So I threaded the top straps in through the back windows and pulled the straps tight.  Again, not as good a fit on my car as it would be on a larger vehicle, but it works.  I have access to the stuff I've packed while inside this tent.  I love the big screened openings  and while this isn't a large tent, it works well for me when I want to go out for the weekend and enjoy nature.  It was very easy to put up - even with my minor difference of having a car instead of a larger vehicle - and seems like a sturdy tent that will last me a long time.  The bag it comes in is roomy and I had no problem getting it back into the bag when packing up.  It's not a small bag, but even though I have a smaller car, it has a good-sized trunk that, even with this tent, still had plenty of room for cooler, cook stove, cot, etc.  I would recommend it for one or two people - nice size for me!"
negative,Don't waste your money on this piece of crap - You will need a pretty powerful corded dril to use it and even then I doubt it would work well...
positive,Received this starter yesterday and we had our mechanic put it on and it worked perfectly. We saved over $80 getting this starter off of Amazon than at our local auto store. We were a little worried about getting a starter off of Amazon but i'm so glad we did because now we're driving and we saved a lot of money and it comes with a 1 year warranty.
positive,Good quality and value.
positive,I replaced the plastic ones that came standard on my Jeep(kept falling off in the car wash) 5 years ago with these and they still look like the day I put them on. Very high quality and you will not be disappointed.
positive,BACK SAVER SHOULD'D OF HAD THIS YEARS AGO
positive,"I ordered this for our upcoming car trip, and it’s ideal for our purposes. While the main compartment functions well as a garbage can, having an easy-access top and a waterproof liner, we’re using it to store binoculars, charging cords, and a couple other small items we want to have at the ready. The side pockets hold water bottles or travel coffee mugs, and the tissue dispenser works well for either a box of tissues or a packet of wet wipes.<br />Very happy with this purchase, it will help keep us organized on our long car tips!"
positive,"Despite the complaints I've read here about inconsistent weld quality, I do not see any really poor welds... just not great welds. Also, the safety of the stand is not very reliant on the welds. The weight of the vehicle is NOT being held up by welds. The welds are keeping the LATERAL/sideways forces in place but NOT the LONGITUDINAL/vertical forces. The casted parts seem of good quality and I like that a secondary backup 'pin' is included so that TWO teeth in the centre stanchion are engaged. Overall I think this is a pretty safe stand design and implementation."
positive,No issues. Good for storage for prepping
positive,Great deal for hitch and wiring. The hardest part was figuring out where the holes were on the body for the fasteners already on the wiring harness. Simple to install. fits perfect.
negative,"So I cleaned the mats with water as instructed, saturated the mats with the cleaner, agitated the cleaner with a stiff brush, and rinsed again... mats actually look dirtier in the after pic than what they started as in the before pic. It's a disappointment.  Buy something more expensive and hope for better results."
negative,7Okay
positive,Highly recommend! Great quality! Made in USA!!!
positive,Good cabin air filter for my truck
negative,"Didn't work on my Triumph without modification, which I did... works now."
positive,Overall great product for the price! This cover has kept the bed of my truck dry and I've really had no issues with it since installing. I will say that it is a bit noisy at highway speeds and you really need to check that the little pins to the latch/lock engage. I've found out that I have to give it a good push down to engage the lock and the tailgate has to be down when I do it or else the end will flip up as I drive.
positive,"My car is washed a couple of times a week, compounded once a year and cleaner waxed three or four times a year. So my experience may be different than others. When I wash it I use a wax and dry spray or hand dry and use Meguiars Ultimate Detailer. The car comes out nice. The last time with trepidation I used the Ice Premium Spray Detailer after a towel dry. I wasn't sorry. The car looked fabulous! The application went really fast spray on and wipe off. I don't buy a product and worry about how long it lasts and beads etc. Beading is over rated IMO."
negative,"Had been using small bottles of ceramic polymer spray from chine which works great. Didn't want to keep dealing with China so after research purchased  this. It is no better than a normal car wax, does not last as long as the china stuff, nor maintain aa finish protection if the short time of water beading is any inference.  Even using their detail spray for  this finish doesn't,t renew as advertised/  Mguire products have diminished in product reliability over the years, this is just another example. Rather order the 1.5 oz bottles from Whisper. It is superior"
positive,"Bought this to replace the original support for the rear door of a 2002 CRV.<br />This is for the door not for the glass on the rear door for those interested.<br /><br />The old part simply would not push the door open and I would be fighting it to open the door at a reasonable speed, one day I got impatient and I pulled a little harder and I blew the seals. So it was about time for a new one.<br /><br />It installs very easy. Just 3 - 10mm bolts. Took all of 10 minutes to remove the old and install the new.<br />Keep in mind once you disconnect the old one the door can now swing freely so if you are not parked on level ground or have something to hold the door in place it can swing past the point that it normally stops and can cause damage to the door.<br /><br />The support holds the door at partly open from about 10%-80%. Outside of that the door either opens fully or closes(may or may not latch depending on position and your latch condition)<br />There is little effort needed to open in and it opens at a good speed."
positive,This garbage can will not fall over and spill
positive,Many of the 350z forums recommended this product. The shop that I use for my car is the premium imported car shop in the area and this is what they use. Happy with the smoother shifting and the piece of mind.
negative,"[[VIDEOID:7b24c7f1877b328133a1875cb30b7a47]] All the photos are black bars. Descriptions says black bars. Customer photos show completely black bars. Not sure what the mix up was here. Description literally says<br />""Color Black<br />Brand Lund<br />Material Black Stainless Steel<br />Exterior Black powder-coated""<br /><br />UPDATE: Does NOT fit 2021 toyota tacoma. Do NOT buy if you have that truck. See video. Nice product, doesn't fit my truck"
positive,"Just the ticket for a cheap &#34;sidestand&#34; for dirt bikes in the garage. Works flawlessly, seems very well made, for what it is."
positive,If you’ve ever had the dreaded check engine light to turn on you know the feeling!! This little gadget will save you money! It works perfect and so far it’s worked on everything I hooked it up to. The app is super simple and very helpful!! I’d highly recommend!  A+
negative,"Junk, these do not do what they're intended to do. They stop the flicker as well as by he DTRs from working at all! The lights flash 3 times thnn shut off and refuse to work. Tho what should I expect, the Auxbeam light connectors had to be flipped the opposite direction in order to work. GARBAGE!! 1/5 stars<br /><br />UPDATE : Supplier got ahold of me and they were upset I was not happy and that it didn't work. They offered me a full refund for my inconvenience. For that I add 2 more stars or excellent customer service. Only not rating any higher as is doesn't work in my car. 3/5 stars"
positive,Many options for fitting
positive,This is a great jumper. Hooked it up and in 10s started my engine on the first try. Look forward to winter!  Easy to charge!
positive,"This thing is amazing. I bought one for my husband, then had to buy one for me. The extended handle allows you to reach across the car, the brush, scraper and the squeegee all work great. It used to take me close to 10 minutes to clean the snow/ice off, now less than 3 minutes."
positive,"It was cute, and cheap and we shall see if it lasts but right now it's cute."
positive,"Very heavy duty. Will tow more than the vehicle can.  Mounts on 2 planes with 16 bolts!  Has d rings, hi lift slots 2 inch receiver with anti rattle bolt.  Works as a step to get to the roof.  It's the hardest to install of any and I have done a bunch.  To get it aligned with both quarters and level I had to slot several mounting holes"
positive,My bracket were the pivot shaft moved was nearly worn thru.  My grandson replaced the bracket and my 1998 Ranger operates like a new truck.
positive,Perfect fit in my tractor.  Everything fit perfectly
negative,"This did fit perfectly and these are very easy to install. However, the motor had a very annoying whine on every speed. Not acceptable on a Lexus. I loved the price but I did end up ordering a OEM Lexus part. So bottom line it works, and if you need heat and air working for less money it is probably an ok part.  I did order from Amazon, and as always impressed with their customer service and return policies."
positive,These car organizer at TOP QUALITY with real leather and not cheap plastic PU leather like most brands. A sensational but ... and I have purchased other brands!  This is right but unless you just like cheap things in your car!
positive,"The ""T"" series from Standard Ignition Products is a lower-tiered line from them (China made, of course). The ""T"" normally stands for ""trash,"" but this rotor is an exception. The Blue Streak rotor this replaced has significantly more rotational play (clearance between the location boss inside the rotor and the corresponding notch in the dizzy shaft) than this one. Probably a fluke, but tighter is better in my book, no spark-scatter, adv/retard of spark just from back and forth play. Normally don't do this much of a review for a bloody rotor, but I felt this one needed it."
positive,"I won't repeat what I said for the Maverick Season 3 box regarding the pricing.  The price gouging policy of Time Warner is true here as well.<br /><br />The series Maverick was created by writer Roy Huggins for James Garner.  When Warner Bros. found that they could not produce at the rate of an episode a week, Jack Kelly was brought on board to ease everyone's burden.<br /><br />Garner's leaving the show after Season 3 gave the general public the impression that the show would not be very good anymore.  However, in my view the shows of Season 4 are entirely satisfactory, and well worth seeing.<br /><br />Moore left after Season 4.  The scripts of Season 5 were quite mediocre, and the show was deservedly cancelled at its conclusion."
positive,The part was just what we needed to repair out very old grasshopper mower!
positive,I love it
positive,Little pricy but to be expected for authenticity. Good thick material and look great!
positive,Excellent product easy to install
negative,doesnt stay strong enough. Lost 2 in couple months
positive,"The original antenna looked like a surf casting rod. I tired of taking it off to wash the car. The whip antenna worked well and I didn't want to lose any reception as I'm on the fringe already. Well, I got much better looks but lost just a touch of reception. Initially I was tempted to send this back and try something else. But, the stations I want to hear come in clearly so I kept it.<br />This looks much better that a long steel whip antenna. The included adapters were simple enough to choose and install the correct one. This looks like it came on the car from the factory. I'll keep it."
positive,These are not chrome! They are chrome colored plastic. They look good on the car but don't expect a metal plate cover.
positive,its a tight fit and took a little work to get it onto the steering wheel but it should last a long time
positive,"Works great on iOS, helped me sort out an issue with a Toyota. Now I keep one in all of my vehicles."
negative,"These were hard to install and too small for passenger side view mirror - can’t see the attached mirror, let alone see any vehicles in my blind spot. Waste of money. :("
negative,Not fit for my car
negative,dIDNT WORK IN MY C5 CORVETTE.  NEVER CONNECTED TO TPM SYSTEM
positive,I'm not sure how this could have less than 5 starts. It does exactly what it is intended for...spare parts.
positive,works great*
positive,"Heavy weight, durable, traps dirt, easy to clean."
positive,"I was skeptical in spite of all the positive reviews, but Mechanic in a Bottle absolutely solved my problem.<br />I heartily recommend MIB for any of the symptoms it's advertised to cure.<br />Here's my story:<br /><br />I ran my two year old 4-cycle gas mower out of gas while cutting the lawn.  I refilled the tank, but the mower refused to run for more that a few seconds.  I suspected old fuel in spite of having used Sta-Bil, so I drained the tank and refilled with freshly bought gas.  Same symptoms.  Then I reckoned that some particles of sludge from the bottom of the tank may have made it to the carburetor when I ran it dry.<br /><br />I went looking for a product to dissolve it.  I've used various carb cleaners and gas additives in the past.  Those that actually worked also were dangerous to plastic parts.  I read about MIB and got some at my local hardware store.<br />I followed the MIB directions of 2 oz in an empty tank for a non-starting engine (as opposed to a rough running one).  I primed the engine by pulling the cord three times with the spark plug disconnected (no primer bulb on my mower).  Then I let it sit over night.  The next day I added a half tank of gas and pulled.  The motor started immediately and died in a few seconds.  Not unexpected with pure MIB in the Carb.  I pulled again.  The engine started again and smoothed out after about 15 seconds of running rough.  It continued to run very smoothly.  I hadn't realized that my engine had previously  been running rough until I experience its post-MIB performance.<br /><br />MIB solved my problem without a doubt.  I love the like-new way the mower runs now.  I will be using MIB as a regular additive from now on."
positive,"Read other reviews about missing parts , wrench not fitting,  packaging no good ,instructions poor , well all is false , just received for my Father's day gift , Looks A-1 TO ME ."
positive,Works good
positive,Fits and blocks glare
positive,I installed these in my dodge 2005 srt 4. They fit perfectly and work much better than others I purchased from another vendor.  They produce and nice strong spray pattern and get the job done.
positive,"Easy to install, works perfectly!"
positive,"See below for missing fifth star.<br /><br />Great for holding a burger and fries. Or your sunglasses and phone. Even your gas station sushi (don’t eat gas station sushi, dude!) And of course the drinks!<br /><br />It does flex a little bit but not enough to spill anything. The tray can swing around if needed and overall pretty good.<br /><br />Here’s the missing fifth star...<br />You pretty much need to remove it if you want a passenger to join you. It would be great if the design let Both people use it. And while putting it in and taking it out is easy enough to do, it’s a bit of a drag."
positive,Worked exactly as described. Would buy again!
positive,Recipient says it works as advertised.
negative,Dress up my car
negative,"The guy below who posted the Volvo review about the seats not fitting - I had the same issue with my 2018 4Runner. I was super excited to get these seat covers, but they do not work with bucket seats and do not meld to the seats. I wish they fit: they are extremely well-made, but these are not compatible with bucket seats: the back bubbles up and moves around because the seat curves inward. Returning, sadly, but hoping maybe the company can resolve this and have something for people with bucket seats."
positive,"as advertised, great quality excellent price, delivered on time"
positive,"I had a misfire on my 2004 Honda Odyssey this past summer.  I only bought a single coil to replace the failed one (to save money).  I knew at the time I should have replaced them all...anticipating another failure.  Unfortunately, that failure happened this past week with 2 others.  This time, I ordered the back of six by ENA confident in their quality.  I've been driving for 5 months on the first replaced coil and everything has been firing fine.  These are a perfect fit, and have fixed my misfires.  I would recommend.  Hoping they will last.  Will update my review if they fail early."
positive,"Good value, perfect fit, performs well."
positive,Product was as described and arrived when promised.
positive,Quality made product.  I really like this!
negative,Somewhat disappointed and have not even installed it yet.<br />First the wires are extremely small will have to splice all four wires to be able to make it work and the hole for the screw that holds the dial to its base was too small I had to drill it to fit the provided screw. I will add that you get what you pay. I have bought another tachometer from sunpro I believe and it was a totally different experience. It was a bit more expensive but I did not have to get extra parts to make it work. This one I will also need a spade connector to connect to the distributor.
negative,"CONS:<br />""Easy Assemble/Disassemble of the fuel siphon pump is great for efficient cleaning. ""<br />DOES NOT DISASSEMBLE !<br /><br />""Siphon""<br />NOT A SIPHON !<br />Flow stops when you stop pumping.<br />A true siphon would keep flowing if the exit hose end is lower than the liquid or input hose end which ever is lower.<br /><br />SIPHON Definition<br />a tube used to convey liquid upwards from a reservoir and then down to a lower level of its own accord. Once the liquid has been forced into the tube, typically by suction or immersion, flow continues unaided.<br /><br />PROS:  none yet"
negative,just ok.  Difficult to assemble -had to use glue to keep it from springing open!!!  Only had for 2 months - already showing wear and tear.  You get what you pay for.....
positive,Very good quality.  Purchased as a Christmas present for my grandson who just purchases his first car.  Praying he never needs them but he'll have them just in case.
positive,Installed in my gy6 150cc and worked perfect some tunning like main jets  flowless
positive,Perfect for my golfcart
positive,Oil change place quoted me $35 to replace this for me. I literally laughed out loud.  Saved $20 and it took me 45 seconds to replace it. Definitely bookmarked to buy again. And I noticed improved mpg immediately.
positive,"Easy to use and immediately eliminated the shuddering issue.  I was hesitant to try but couldn’t ask for a better, inexpensive solution."
positive,2001 Accord has 2 cabin filters and this items contains both.  Took me 1/5 hour after viewing a YouTube lesson on how to change the filter.  You have to pull the old dirty filter out of the plastic frame and insert these filters.  Not a problem.
positive,This is the fourth set I’ve bought for my kids. We’ve tried other brands and these fit the best and easiest to install.
negative,Quality is as good as what came on the 85 Blazer when new - which is questionable at best.  Recommends replacing every 20-25k miles?  Can't vouch for longevity but the threads are weak.  Immediately crossthreaded with very little pressure and I had to chase the threads to make it functional.<br /><br />Appears to be the exact same product as Autozone/Oreilly/Advance with different stickers.  Probably as good as you can get without buying premium braided stainless stuff.
negative,These flicker very badly.
positive,"I'm really happy with these lights, they where extremely well priced and seem to be made fairly well made, you can spend hundreds on lights that are no better quality these are the way to go"
positive,"Not required, but is inexpensive and recommended by the manufacturer as a preventative maintenance item.  Was specifically formulated for MY '99-'02, but is recommended for all Subaru engines 4 or 6 cyl."
positive,"Good quality product.  Takes a little bit of effort to get the plate in on the last corner, but not bad.  One of our cars had a rear license plate that would rattle on the mount.  This took care of that and looks nice, too."
positive,They look great on my 2010 ram 1500 big horn. wish they came with led reverse lights. A lot of reviews said they malfunction or the seals leak but I haven’t had any problems with mine so far 🤞🏼 Been three months
negative,Not bad for the price but is a little to big cause the the back driver side control not to function
negative,didn't work on its own or with 0000 steal wool. I usually Love Meguiar's products however not this one :(
positive,"Does what it's supposed to.  Flashing light means it's charging; solid means it's charged.<br />Comes with three attachments -- alligator clips, o-rings for permanent installation, and a cigarette lighter plug for older vehicles where you can charge the battery via the cigarette lighter."
positive,Nice belt great quality. would recommend to anyone. super happy with this brand as i have used them for years
positive,"Such a cool product, ordered it for my 12 yo daughter to ride and listen to music!"
positive,Fix my skipping problem
negative,I really wanted this to work but no matter what I couldn't get it to stop rolling to be able to stick🙄
negative,"Part was as expected, and works well for DODGE / CHRYSLER 3.5 L V-6 engines<br />( better than OEM ).<br />Seller's shipping costs are a bit high for these small items."
negative,Tubing slips in the clamp. Broke the clamp tightening wing screw after making 5 bubble flares.
positive,Fits great on a Rav4. Really cute!
positive,Went on easy with instructions.  So far so good.  Thanks.
positive,Perfect. Amazing price and just what my son needed. Thank you
positive,prefect fit ... look really good .. does a great job
positive,great little units
positive,Great price for a great product
positive,Installed almost a year ago. Working like a champ still. As good as factory I'd say. Perfect fit and quality seems up there with OEM.
negative,Not very bright. Went with hids after this purchase.
positive,This is my second purchase of this phone case. I don’t really use the clip part at all I mainly use the case. It provides good protection for my phone and I like the way it looks.
positive,"The size is perfect for carrying in my Ford Mach-E in case of need.  The size to power/weight is perfect, small enough but with power enough.  EVs all have 12-volt batteries they use to get electronics powered up and they have been known to fail in low temp or under certain conditions.  This one is the right battery for that emergency."
positive,Great product and delivered as promised.
positive,Once a month you should check the air pressure COLD in the morning before moving the car. This gauge does the trick with perfection
positive,"awesome box, great shipping"
positive,Works great
positive,I bought this part to fix my fan issue after I troubleshoot it. Got my 2002 TDI golf worked well
positive,looks ugly cutty.
positive,"Great quality and value. Best price online and to top it off, great company , very communicative if any issues arise."
positive,Bueno
negative,"Who knows if I found the leak? Someone on newbeetle.org suggested the oil cooler gasket and sure enough, that was the problem. This dye didn't help on this leak. Maybe I didn't shine the light in the right place but when oil is leaking from the oil cooler gasket, drops of oil are everywhere! I couldn't identify it this way."
positive,"I thought it sounded like a great idea and truth be told, I think it is so long as you don't have a front seat passenger when you want to use it.  I mean, it definitely obstructs their view!  But what I thought when I received it was how cheaply made it was - two jumbo office clips a small flat piece of metal and a ring of metal (I thought about when I was a kid and made paper wreaths around a metal clothes hanger bent into a circle) clipped onto the visor.  Good concept, but the execution is a bit amateurish and especially for the price.  I do like my hats and I have used this ""hat rack"" but I think it could be a bit more ""finished"" if that makes sense."
positive,great
positive,Very bright!!!!
positive,"Have only been using it for short while but it is an impressive piece of equipment.  Rugged, accurate with a clear visual readout.  If you are in the market for a good tire air pressure gage this is a very good choice."
positive,"Great bag! Great size fit my kid's pack 'n play and two duffel bags no problem. Quality material, had no issues with it while driving over the mountain from Reno to Portland not a drop of water got to my things and we were driving though the snow this bag is definitely water proof. Very satisfied would definitely suggest this to anybody especially for the price!"
positive,i am getting back into riding after a break... wanted to make a small investment on some essential gear but not break the bank. i received these gloves and the winter gloves (cause you need both...right??).  cold weather gloves are awesome hands were instantaneously warm putting them on and lasted throughout the ride. Knuckle gloves were awesome during the day ride. To get 2 pair of QUALITY gloves for this kind of price is far and few between these days. I love them and intend to replace with the same when or if needed.  All the best.. keep the rubber side down!!
positive,Cheap and worked
positive,look great
positive,"LOVE IT.  Need to find out what other Navy key tags they make (ship names, etc.) ?"
positive,"It's small, but sticks in place very well.  When the GPS is removed, I simply leave the base on the dash.  It isn't in the way at all."
positive,"100% Genuine steering fluid at a cheap price in a bundle, you cannot go wrong with this! I’m pretty sure the stealership would charge an arm and a leg for 1 bottle. Came extremely quick, no damage, highly recommend. Plus you shouldn’t be putting any other liquid inside a Honda vehicle."
negative,I ordered the brown color. It is nothing like the color they show. It is a dark brown and does not match at all. They also have a nasty smell to them.
negative,"I read the reviews and ordered a size down. I put it on and it fit great, wiggle room in the pants and the jacket fit as expected for a size medium but any small movement and the crotch rips instantly. Absolutely no way you could ever bend or sit without it completely ripping open butt to front. Not worth the money. Get your sewing machine out because that's the only way you'll be able to wear this product. You'll have to add fabric to the crotch and double stitch it. It's pleather and definitely warm. If the stitching held it'd be a great costume but you literally can't move without it ripping."
positive,"Great set of brakes ...and new parts, not refurbed.  I installed easily and brakes are now just like when she was a new Jeep.  Good price and fast delivery makes it easy to highly recommend this seller also."
positive,"Why would anyone use anything else?  I've used this on lawn tractors (mine, a neighbor's, my mother-in-law's), 4 wheelers and passenger tires, and it's worked quickly and effectively each and every time.  If you've ever used that ""spray can"" flat fixer, you may be skeptical.  Kick the can and make the switch."
positive,Great lights works great on my motorhome.
positive,"I haven't had to depend on this product yet (thankfully), but I can say that most drivers don't tailgate me nearly as much as they used to. The yellow logo really stands out and most people back off or change lanes. I didn't realize the entire product was made of rubber, but I don't think it will be an issue.<br /><br />My one gripe is that the piece that goes into your trailer receiver is a little long for a Toyota 4Runner and as a result I can't get the pin into the correct hole on the HitchHammer and the product sticks out a little too far. I plan to trim it up a bit so that I can get the HitchHammer in the proper spot. My fear right now is that if the HitchHammer is too far out that it would fold sideways and break rather than hold it's ground."
positive,Perfect fit<br />Easy to replace
positive,Cute! Took about 5 minutes to put on
positive,"This nozzle is so much better than the OEM nozzle.  At first, my right nozzle went out, so I went to the dealer and paid $35 for one.  Right after I fixed one nozzle, the other went out.  This time I order these in a pair for a fraction of the price.  This nozzle was a perfect and was easy to install. NOW, what I really like about this nozzle is that you can adjust the direction and height of the spray on the windshield; which you cannot do on the OEM nozzle."
positive,Worked as we needed.
negative,"Ordered 4 of them, one of them has a lot less resistance than other three. Some have really deep scratches and paint-less areas near welds. One of them had an oval hole so i had to drive the bolt with a hammer. In my opinion, not worth the 73$ price tag. And Made in USA tag don't mean jack… Laughable quality."
negative,I like the packaging and quality but the brightness level is lower than expected!  This is claimed to offer 300 Lumens but other 250 Lumens bulbs are brighter than this.
positive,Very satisfy with quality
positive,"great,  good product"
positive,"Stamped made in USA. Hopefully this is a quality product and not the over seas made steering stabilizer sold under 50 different brands by slapping a sticker on it.  Paint is horrid... Not full coverage, Orange peel textures and they painted right over the bushing,. No pride in the product.  No quality control. Waiting for the mounting kit to arrive as apparently it fits best if not mounted using the oem hardware. For 09 2500hd Duramax"
positive,Great thick-real rubber oem mats<br /><br />Perfect fit on 2023 cx-5
negative,Quality  in relation to cast seems more “dollar store”<br />Will see how long it lasts Scrubbing lapstrake
positive,to release was difficult especially for my wife until I rounded the locking clip ever so slightly with a file.<br />still holds tight for safety but when squeezing the release unclips easily
positive,DRZ 125L.  Works well.  The Gold Standard.
positive,"For a while I was looking for something to block the sun from hitting my face, the sun visors would not reach and would always hit me but with this item I solved the problem fit perfectly on my Ford Expedition."
positive,good price. Easy to use.
negative,"These fit, but it’s a weird fit. They’re also quite flimsy, and don't hold their shape well. The cargo area one doesn’t stay in place super well. Definitely do the job of covering/protecting the carpets though. The driver and passenger ones loosely clip over the latches. I spent a few minutes trying to get them to fit snugly but they just don’t."
negative,"This will not fit the block heater plug on any of my vehicles. It will fit the light gauge extension cord, but I cannot imagine why I would want this on it. I finally put this on a couple of outdoor Christmas lights that I leave up rather than crawl on the roof to take down. They will work there.<br />Plastic, including the extended part that hooks around the cord and holds the cap when removed from the plug. All of this seems flimsy, and I would not count on it lasting for long."
positive,"Just what I was ;looking for.  Speedy shipping, and it works great!"
positive,This was absoulty necessary to get the gas tank &#34;cap&#34; off so I could change out the fuel pump in my BMW 530i E39.  Its not a perfect match to the BMW metal ring but it engaged and worked perfectly for me.  Would have been impossible to open without this tool!
positive,keeps my seats clean  Looks great in the car too
positive,"It came well packaged and protected, and they even included extra double-sided tape. But you won't need it unless you remove it.<br />It's a good snug fit, and relatively easy to install."
positive,Perfect fit! And sturdier than other after-market filters I have bought. Still a pain to install in Dodge/Jeep autos - but youtube helps!!
positive,Replaced antenna on two of my vehicles.  I haven't noticed any signal drop.  Works and looks great (if you do notice it).  It's low profile and doesn't get in the way.  You do however lose the ability to gauge the vehicle's height when driving under anything low.
positive,5 stars for the sound alone. It's super loud and awesome! I LOVE IT!!!!
positive,"Fast delivery, great product"
positive,work well
negative,"I bought this one used but it showed up without any instructions , missing nuts and bolts, cheap....."
negative,"It works so it's getting 3 stars, but it soaks SO much product along the way. I have no idea why the handle has to be made out of foam too. It just ends up soaking part of the product too. I've had cheaper alternatives with the handle made out of a different non-foam material or just no handle at all and it would work better. Other than that, once is soaked up good, it applies product evenly to the tire."
positive,"It's a smidge long for my 4-Runner, but it is a great shade.  Not flimsy at all, very sturdy and easy to put in place (no tucking behind visors and just praying it stays in place).  No sagging in the middle.  Seems to hold up very well, definitely recommend!"
negative,Just Installed it day before yesterday and it went out this morning.
positive,Great fit for my 2003 WJ.
negative,"I'm sure that this decal might have been great, seemed like a good idea and deal but unfortunately I never received it from the seller. Only a refund for purchasing it. So this isn't a obscene or profound of hate comment as Amazon is putting it. It is a negative comment because the seller doesn't do as advertised through Amazon. Wouldn't purchase again"
positive,Adapted perfectly on my grand prix gxp.
positive,Fit and worked perfectly on my 2008 Acura TSX. Very impressed for the price. Also didn't have to deal with a core charge.
positive,Just plain awesomeness.
positive,"This replaced the original struts perfectly. Before the replacement if I hit a bump in a turn the car would loose traction, and on hard acceleration it had wheel hop. The Monroe sensa-trac struts restored the handling made my car much safer to drive.<br />Here is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars. The photo shows the strut replacement with a new rubber boot/dust shield. This is NOT included. I had to use the old boot. For some reason the old boot rubs on the new strut and makes an awful creaking sound that is LOUD. I changed 2 struts and both make this noise. I contacted monroe's customer service and they said spray some silicone spray on it. This helped for about 10 miles but it came back."
positive,Fits 2014 Challenger SXT perfectly.
positive,Very handy. Hold bolts and nuts securely
positive,"What can I say, Rain X makes a great product!"
negative,Worked well while it lasted. But after 3 months it burned out and stopped working.
positive,"The Modern Steel Metallic paint is a good match for Acura NSX Y Spoke wheels. The dispenser is a good design which includes the paint, an abrasive brush and clear coat in one container. This touch up paint dispenser has the same problem as most others though - once opened and used it will dry up within a year or two and need to be replaced."
positive,Perfect mount to hold phones with hard cases. I have a iPhone 11 max pro and this mount holds it perfect!
positive,I’m a bedrug fan. I like the fact it helps protects my truck bed dents and dings and it helps to keep things from sliding around as much. I have a spray in liner and it only seems to make things slide more.
positive,I love these hooks. They go right onto the headrest in seconds. They are strong and can hold a lot of weight. We hang backpacks on them to make it easy for the kids to grab them when they are getting dropped off at school. They are good quality.
positive,My new cars key fob seemed a bit flimsy so I ordered this for extra protection. I haven’t dropped my keys since I got them however these fit very snug so I believe the fob will be protected in the event of a drop.
positive,Very easy to install.  You will feel good and you will have clean air inside your car!
negative,"We were literally able to use this ""once."" That means: we put it on, drove, we're able to gas up ONCE. The next time we went for gas, it is stuck. Now we need to take it to the dealer (yikes!) for removal!<br />We got it for a jeep patriot, which it said it fit. >:(<br /><br />We had purchased a separate one for a Prius... we haven't had any problems with that.<br /><br />Update: we had to take the problem lock to the jeep dealer to be removed. $$<br />The one on the Prius is still good. So I am adding a star. ;)"
positive,Fit perfect
positive,nice and heavy. built to spec.  snug perfect  fit.  no loss in power!  cant go wrong with these in addition to your plugs!
positive,Worked great replacing the rusted out one on my 99 f350 7.3 diesel superduty.!
positive,"Why fight a holster when this one just accepts your plug with even the laziest of actions?  When it's cold and raining, the last thing you wanna do is mess around with cord management.  Trust me, this will solve your issue.  Easy to mount, easier to use."
positive,Perfect
positive,This is a great little battery tester. I have found it to be most accurate if I take a reading after driving it around the block than at a stone-cold sit. So far it has not let me down. All lights and gauges work as expected. No complaints.
positive,Identical and not difficult to replace.
positive,Made my couch look better again. It was easy and it dries fast.
negative,"I’ve had this for about three years and I’ve used it on a lot of batteries. I don’t find it useful because when you enter the CCA rating for the battery, after the tester does the expected checks of voltage and continuity between the cells, it compares the CCA to a number it somehow pulls from the battery. If the number isn’t within an expected range, it tells you to recharge the battery and try again. When you recharge the battery, it usually passes the tests.<br /><br />What it doesn’t pick up is the ability of the battery to hold a charge for any length of time. So I’ve seen batteries pass the tests and fail to start a car a day later because they can’t hold a charge.  If this device were actually capable of doing a test under load, it would detect this fault in the battery.  But it can’t. It only detects obvious faults like low voltage, which you could see with a volt meter, or disconnects between cells, which again you could see with a volt meter.<br /><br />It has the ability to read alternator output.  I don’t know if it accurately does this since the alternators I’ve tested with it all seemed to work well. The tester just confirmed this. I haven’t tested a bad alternator."
positive,"For the price, I suspect this will hold up well enough. I've had a couple of similar covers, and one ""better"" cover, and this material lasts much longer for the price. This stays on my Jeep Wrangler in all kinds of weather for at least two weeks at a time. Then I wad it up, stuff it in a duffle bag, and take the Jeep for a short drive. A day  or so later, it's back on the Jeep. If you have a perfectly smooth, clean, dry, still surface to fold this back up, you might actually get it back in the bag it came in. Trying to do that outside in the wind and rain on gravel pavement makes it impossible. Get a duffle bag, roll the cover up and stuff it in there. For the price, if it lasts more than 6 months, it's worth it to me. I haven't had a cover yet that lasted a full year of being outside. I have another one similar to this that's coming close to a year outside on another vehicle. It's under trees. It's ugly, but it hasn't torn, and the pickup it's covering is staying dry. It looks like the same material as this one, but it seems thinner, if that's possible.  I like the straps on this better than others I've had. I like that it seems thicker. I'm hoping it holds up through summer. This one might actually make a full year."
positive,"We've used this about three times now, and it seems to be doing well.  Super easy to clean, and really helps keep the area under our awning looking tidy.  There is one spot that seems to be coming apart, but it is very small and probably where one of the kids was pulling at it.  Love how easy this is to roll out and roll back up, and how quick it is to sweep off."
positive,Easy to bend with a small tube bender.
positive,"I'm glad I got this set, brakes on my car were pretty bad and these were a fantastic price! If you've never replaced breaks watch a YouTube video for your vehicle as these will not come with any instructions."
positive,Installed a week ago so far so good.
positive,"I love pink colour!!! Moreover the quality is perfect, don't hesitate to buy this product"
positive,"Beautifully presented.  Love the plate itself.  However, my screw caps wouldn’t stay on."
positive,Thanks!
positive,These are just a nice way to finish off exposed screws—on your license plate or elsewhere. I've never had one come loose and they look great. Would definitely recommend.
positive,Saw these recommended on YouTube.  Very easy to use and will definitely get more.  Makes tire/rubber dressings easy to apply with no mess.
positive,"My other air-horn went out and this one is a great replacement. It was a bit big, but the mechanic got it to fix. It is loud and I love it! Only takes a minute to fill up (literally) if I use my horn or it's really cold in the morning."
positive,"I was really confused with all of the options.  First the problem:  I have a 2002 Chrysler PT Cruiser.  The ignition key sometimes wouldn't turn to start the vehicle.  I could push the key in hard, pull it in and out and eventually it would work.  I wanted to fix it myself.  What's confusing is I didn't know if I needed to replace the lock and the keys and I didn't know if I had to reprogram the keys/fob, etc.  This is the thing that you want.<br /><br />The idea is straight forward...you keep the same keys you already have.  you then re-key this lock so it works for your keys. a bit of nomenclature.  If you change the locks in your house, they call it ""re-keying"" which means new mechanism in the lock as well as new keys.  Here, they call it ""Coding"" the cylinder, which just means that you adjust this thing so it works with your existing keys.  You also want to pay extra for ""automatic"" coding which is that big orange device in the picture.  That just makes adjusting this lock to your key easier.  The instructions are not perfect so read through them a couple of times and study the mechanism.  I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />So, as long as you already have keys that work, this is the best option.  The picture I attached shows the __old__ cylinder.  Notice the rust.  I guess that is what was causing the problem.  You __could__ just remove the old cylinder, clean and derust it and that would likely be enough to get your lock working great again.  But for me it was worth the money to get this new one as the old one is almost 20 years old and would eventually really break and I'd be stuck."
positive,Perfect for what it does.
negative,"does not fit on 15"" standard steel corolla rims as advertised"
positive,Perfect Fit!
positive,Good service but we couldn’t program the key to work. No problem with return.
negative,awful...and cheap
negative,fit my 2007 tacoma trd perfect and matched the grey plus easy to install.. update to this product. after just 2 months its already tearing away from mirror and now looks like crap... ive hardly used the visor...5 star to 3 star..
positive,2 minute to install with just a Philips screwdriver! And fit perfectly on my 2011 Audi q5 3.2T!
positive,Works great with Forscan.
positive,"My new Rug Doctor Spot Cleaner came yesterday, I used it this morning, and I am SOLD!  I own a Kirby foam carpet cleaner, and it is awesome.  However, it does not have any small attachments with which to clean upholstery or autos and is pretty clunky for cleaning stairs.  I thought I would continue to use the trusty rental from our local hardware store for my upholstery and cars - it comes with a great upholstery kit.  But I ran out of time before I got to every project, and had an aching back from lugging such a huge machine up and down the stairs.  Plus, one of my sofa cushions dried with a funny water stain again - argh!  So I gave in and treated myself to my very own little cleaning machine, so I can clean whenever I want.  Note - I do not have pets.  I am simply a mom with three boys and a husband who wasn't taught to remove his shoes indoors as a child - as a result, I have plenty of dirt and lots of spots from accidents like sippy cup milk spills and beer tipped over during a football game.  Our carpets are a safe tan plush.  My upholstery is tan also (what was I thinking!).<br /><br />Rug Doctor versus Bissel - I read all the reviews and decided to get the Rug Doctor based on more suction power, a wider upholstery cleaning head, the brush that can be turned on and off (nice to buff up carpet on the stairs), and the fact that the water spray is below the suction, so you can actually see where it is going - super handy on cushions!<br /><br />This is not a review for the cleaning solution, I haven't used it yet.  I had to return my rental before I could rinse my stairs, so the first thing I did was fill the Rug Doctor with clean water and rinse my stairs.  It did a great job - and I had my first ever &#34;clean swath&#34; moment on that difficult step lip that never seems to get clean, thanks to the suction window (see below).  I also sprayed Resolve foam on my couch cushion with the funny water spot, rubbed it in, let it set for five minutes, and rinsed the cushion three times, and it came clean.<br /><br />Pros:  the clear window on the attachment that lets you see bubbles and dirt (this makes it SO easy to tell if you have rinsed enough, or need to go over again with a rinse or more soap)  The wheels, pull handle, and lift handle - I have fragile joints and a lot of pain, so this machine is perfect for mobility.  True, it's not built like it would have been even ten years ago, but if I am careful the plastic should last.  The cord and hose wrap up nicely.  It looks adorable.  It stores easily.  It cleans easily.  It also empties easily.  Note:  even after reading all the reviews, I still spilled dirty water the first time, albeit on my counter - please note that the dirty water tank has a hole at the top that is ALWAYS OPEN, not just the bottom hole, which is only opened when cleaning for storage.  I didn't see it at first.  That made me laugh.  It is very easy to dump the dirty water because you don' have to take a lid off.  Smart idea.<br /><br />Cons:  It could use a longer cord.  My have 16 steps to my stairs, with an outlet at top and bottom.  I could only clean 10 stairs before having to unplug and replug.  It does sit nicely on the stairs tho, and is easy to move from step to step while working.  The biggest design flaw, in my opinion, is the clean water tank.  No, it does not sit flat for filling, which would be nice, but I measure my cleaner instead of using fill lines, so not a huge issue.  My issue is the only opening in this tank is the one on the bottom that feeds the machine - it has a nice tight rubber seal, much like a blender.  Because I rinse a lot, I fill with clean water a ton.  It would be SO much easier it there was an opening on the top (much like the dirty water) where I could keep adding fresh rinsing water, rather than tug the jug out of its fitting and then take that sealed lid off.  Just a thought, Rug Doctor!<br /><br />HINT:  If you lose suction, empty the dirty water.  Once it hits about 70% full, suction disappears.  If your water won't spray, you have dirt in the line - rinse the jug and intake, keep trying, and the spray will come back!"
positive,Great sales great support and the part is better than new factory parts . I can't say enuff about this supplyer thay could not do better . I will order from this supplyer again . Thanks it fit .
positive,"good oil at a good price. I will use this in my lawn and garden equipment. Why not 5 stars, Hard for me to love something that can't love you back"
positive,Much less expensive than OEM headlight clips. These are large enough to fit big headlights and can be modified easily with pliers to fit smaller lights.  Fantastic value.
positive,"Not sure about the negative reviews, mine have been in for 6 months and great so far.  Nice yellow light, good brightness and the yellow light is really good for cutting through fog/mist as that is the optimal color to do it.  I have to assume that half the reviews where a bulb is burnt out the person installing them touched the bulb with their finger or didn't clean the bulbs off with rubbing alcohol and a lint free cloth prior to install which can cause them to burn out really fast."
positive,"A handwashed vehicle is something to be proud of, especially when you do it yourself. Instead of ruining some old rags, risking scratching your vehicle with any excess rock/debris, buy this and you'll back/hands will be thanking you later. Literally, just a little bit of car wash soap w/ elbow grease, and you turn a 20-30 minute job into 5-10 minutes with less stress on your body.<br />I will provide photos the next time I clean my motorvehicle.<br />Disclaimer: I'm just a dude who likes to keep things clean."
positive,"Due to Christmas season, I have not started this project."
positive,good
positive,"It fits right under the back seats so that when the seats are down, they act as a lid to the storage. Like other reviewers, I drilled a couple of holes in the back to bolt it securely to the small storage compartment already under the seat. This works better than the included straps. It won't go anywhere.<br /><br />I also have a sturdy mat that this is sitting on and it still works. The capacity is nice. I can put tow hitches, straps, bungee cords, tow ropes, air compressor, small tool kit, tire repair kit, jumper cables, additional jack if I need one, and still seem to have plenty of room for more stuff...who knows, perhaps there is a secret decoder ring back there too! Now we're talkin'!<br /><br />Anyway, I am pleased."
negative,Nothing wrong with the parts themselves....its the lack of adhesive that drives me nuts. There's only a 1/4 inch strip of 3M tape around the perimeter...and it doesn't even surround the whole perimeter.  There's no doubt it would fall off very quickly and it certainly wouldn't seat well.  I could add double sided tape but I don't want to.
positive,I prefer NGK plugs for all my small equipment.
positive,Bought this upper motor mount for a 2007 Cadillac DTS. It was a perfect fit and took about 15 minutes to install. I do some of my own mechanic work and almost all of my own maintenance work on my vehicles. This was a no brainer. Probably saved myself at least $50 in labor. I checked the price at auto zone and Amazons price with free shipping was comparable. I ordered it and went to work. When I got home from work the next day it was waiting for me to install. No need to drive to auto zone. Thanks for the convenience Amazon.
positive,"I didn't have an emergency kit in my car and it was one of those things I would think, &#34;Okay, sometime I'll put one together.&#34;  Sound familiar?  Never happened.  So I got this kit as an antidote for my procrastination and it has turned out to be quite suitable.<br /><br />The included components, while not of industrial quality, would still be adequate in an emergency:  LED Flashlight, plastic poncho for the inevitable rain, a &#34;HELP&#34; sign that can be put in a window, a can of tire sealant with a electric tire pump (with a built-in LED to see what you are doing on the tire when you are stuck on the side of a road, at night, in a rainstorm, and feel miserable), a set of jumper cables, gloves, screwdriver, zip ties, a bungee cord, a thin blanket you can kneel on at roadside, and finally, a basic first aid kit.<br /><br />Each of these items can be very useful in an emergency situation.  And of great importance, the kit comes in a sturdy carrying bag, so these items are in your car, convenient and available when needed.<br /><br />I have added two other items though:  First, 2 roadside flares.  Having flares can be a lifesaver.  2nd, I've added some additional basic first aid items.  They don't take up much room and don't have expiration dates.<br /><br />It's one of those things you hope you never need to use, but are so glad to have - in one convenient bag, as a &#34;just in case.&#34;"
positive,How love how this folds up neatly and I can tuck it beside the passenger seat.  I works great!
positive,"You'll need a pro to cut the key, but the FOB can be programmed yourself.<br /><br />The instruction are below, and know it does work, but it may take doing it many times and getting &#34;lucky&#34;.<br /><br />Give yourself an hour to 1.5 hours to fiddle around with this."
positive,love it
negative,returned
positive,"it was just like advertised 2 -16"" x 4' I use them for cattle fly wipes as they come in the barn"
positive,Just put this on my car it looks great! was reasonable easy to adhere to my car and it looks great I hope it holds up over time and last.
negative,These look like great LED bulbs but I'm unable to install them correctly in a 2020 Jeep Wrangler JL. They only offer a very limited rotation. An LED bulb should be position vertically with LEDs facing left and right. Unfortunately even after playing with the rotation adjustment there is no way to properly orient the bulb in this Jeep's halogen housing.
positive,Easy to use.
positive,I used this car grill mesh to fabricate a grill to protect my oil cooler on my 2011 BMW R1200RT. It worked perfectly and looks great.
positive,Just got this cover. Have to leave car in driveway for a few weeks and didn’t want tree droppings on it. Tried it on today and I am so happy. Fits nice and looks sharp. It’s summer now and very hot but I think it will weather well. Also like the 3 straps. A bit windy here too.
positive,"Bolted right on with no problem, was able to remove rear plug for my power brakes , no problem. Car runs much better  Great deal"
positive,Works as it should.
positive,2002 Pontiac Montana fit perfect
negative,"Quality of plate is good, graphics are nice, just no text on the top. Weird. Still I kinda like it as it is so no problem. When you see it you have to think ‘peace, love, dogs’ rather than having it spelled out."
positive,"perfect fit for my NOCO XL, keeps everything in one convenient location and protected from being knocked around in my truck. Very happy with my purchase."
positive,worked perfectly for a great price.  Order a 9v battery because it does not come with one.
positive,"Wish they were 2 or 3 inches wider,  towards the center of the bike. I would buy again"
positive,This product works for my needs as not everyday tool.
positive,worked
negative,"Good idea  but horrible execution, does not last  comes off in a month, waste of 25 bucks"
positive,Fast shipping fits like a glove
negative,Installed and locked myself out of my jeep before I realized it is missing major operational parts like the springs.
positive,"We have a little used pickup, a garden tractor and a 52"" lawn mower to protect plus three 5 gallon cans for refills when necessary.  So we need more than 4 cans this size treat all our fuel for the winter.  We sadly learned our lesson the hard way when the first spring out of storage the garden tractor would not start.  Ultimately we had to winch it onto a trailer and have the dealer correct the problem.  As they handed me the eye-popping bill when I came  to pick it up, they mentioned, ""you would not believe how much water we had to purge from your fuel system including your fuel injectors and cleaning them""!  Lesson learned!"
positive,They look awesome. But the Holdsworth cut out exactly right to match up with my post holes. Which is okay by me cuz I don't use them anyways
negative,Plastic is too thick. Easily twice as thick as the factory filter. Distorts the airvo and is unacceptable. I will be returning and buying genuine Subaru air cleaners.
negative,Pretty good soap. Smells good suds up nice. I am not sold it cleans any better than cheaper soaps. I still had to scrub
negative,this thing does absolutely nothing. I have not noticed a difference and the car still smells. the only thing that helps was cleaning the car and using an actual air freshener.
positive,worked good
positive,"I've heard lots of bad things about those chinese knockoffs not fitting right and threads not being the same, so I just went ahead and ordered the real Motorcraft thing and Bingo! no problems at all installing it, the only thing is that the gasket wasn't included, it costs approx $2.40 at AutoZone, oh well, I'm happy cause no more coolant leaks! my truck is a 1997 and it was the original part that finally gave away to corrosion, 21 years isn't so bad, I hope this one lasts as much as the original."
negative,"the mirror is too small and, it's too hard to adjust for direction. I suspect it would break easily if I tried to move it too much."
positive,Awesome product
positive,Perfect fit great price well packaged!
positive,"Easy to install, good value for the money"
negative,Unfortunately the wires are not correctly put in place. You have to move the positive down to the center which is dumb. They have no leads so you have to make your own leads to the source that you're powering. You will have to buy connectors. Not sure if I'm going to keep it actually I may just return it. The other one I bought had labels and you were able to label each switch this one doesn't have that feature I'd like it. I may return it just for the fact that there's no labels and that you have to make your own leads.
positive,Great bag for buck..
positive,"My generator tire was flat, I added this tube to the existing wheel and it has held air and fixed my problem for at least 6 months. I am so glad I found this solution instead of replacing the wheel. Install took about 30 min…"
positive,"I was putting on new tires, so I decided to upgrade the valve stems from the ugly black plastic. These went on very easily, sealed perfectly, and look great.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- They look great even if you don't have custom rims. Black plastic is ugly and detracts from the looks of your vehicle. These look much better and blend in with custom rims to create a seamless look.<br />- Easy to install. The rubber part you see in the pictures is a 2-piece seal, just unscrew the nuts, slide the bottom part of the seal off, stick it through the hole, put the seal back on, and tighten the nuts. You're done.<br />- Good air seal. You don't even have to torque the nuts really hard to get a good seal with this design.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- You do have to pop the bead on one side of the tire, so unless you have the right tools and a big air compressor, this isn't a DIY job. But if you're getting new tires anyway, that would be a great time to upgrade the looks of your valve stems.<br />- No good way to keep the angled stem aligned where you want it when you're tightening the nuts. They should have either a full hex pattern or at least opposing flattened sides on the outside part of the stem so you can put a wrench on it.<br /><br />I like these and will probably get another set when it's time to put new tires on my other vehicle."
positive,"I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that this wasn't just a tire gauge. It comes with multiple little pieces that could come in handy if you, for example, are changing a tire at night and lose the little valve cap. This has replaced the old analogue tire gage in my car and I am very happy with its accuracy."
positive,Perfect fit!
positive,I have had a couple of these Clocks for years  and they are still running . I found that you shouldn't put it on a wall that's next to a door the opening and closing of the door moves the clock. I also use good batteries Duracell kind not cheap ones.
positive,the sticker's quality is good but not amazing. but the price is cheap and worth it if you are a fan.
positive,Works great on my leather interior
positive,"Easy to install  although it should be noted that the heat sink and fan extends farther than the original light and might interfere with parts in the engine compartment as mine did but none the less, it was still easy to install. They look great."
positive,Fit perfect and easy to install
negative,Not worth the money. Does little if anything to reduce noise or vibration.
positive,"i use this in my old hoopty escort,as dash lites.i have to take steering wheel off and air bag just to get the dash out to change dash lites.this product is a great lite for my needs.has worked flawless for many months."
positive,Perfect fit! I love it. I measured my head and went to the fly racing website and looked at the measurements and ordered by size. I tried on their website but they were out of stock. So I came to amazon knowing my size and ordered. Perfect fit and came in packaged just perfect.
positive,In my opinion theyre better than the other brand just because theyre odorless.
positive,"They fit and light up well. not as bright as the regular 194s but close enough. If you are trying to save amps without having to use resistors like I am, try to do it often."
positive,Fits as expected. Needs to have a tether to the gas cap door like the OEM standard fuel cap.
positive,Put these on my 14 Xterra and I love them!!! They look great and stop me much better then stock ever did. Easy to install and fit was perfect.
negative,It's oil.  You put it in your engine to lube stuff up.  Works as advertised.
positive,Looks great<br />Easily fits on my sun visior<br />Stays in place<br />So glad they made this!!
positive,Works Good
positive,ok
positive,Just as expected gave as gifts to my nephews they enjoyed them.
positive,The quality of this frame is excellent.  It's made of plastic and the lettering was great.
positive,bed rails fit like a glove.after they were installed I had to stand on the bed rails to clean leafs off the carport and they didn't crack or get damaged in anyway and I wiegh 300 lbs. easy to install on my 04 dakota pick up.fast shipping too.......
positive,Works as it should
positive,"This was part of a gift,a,d he loves it!  Has it hanging off his  mirror in his Soltice car"
negative,Useful for use on vehicles when there are long periods without use.
positive,"Put in my mini-van, works great.  Different attachment options"
negative,"This arrived with a few scratches. It took an hour (using a separate attachment) to inflate my paddle board. There are photos of air mattresses and inflatable rafts in the listing. This is not made for anything that large.  I wouldn’t recommend it for anything larger than a soccer ball, a small swimming float, or maybe topping off my car tire. I took a break about half way through to let it cool down because the hose became very hot. It’s also quite loud, as you would expect from an air compressor. I’m not sure why other reviewers would call it quiet."
positive,A must have for any toolbox professional or DIY guy
negative,"Works OK but not great. Must use a fair amount and scrub to remove bugs, and very weak on tar."
positive,"Nice lights. They are very bright! Wish there were other lenses like smoked. I replaced my other lights that had burnt out due to water. For this set, I took some superglue and applied it around the perimeter of the lense just to seal to be safe. Also, note(!) This only fits the TRD Pro grill. Luckily I had some plastic clips from my previous install that adapts it to the Sport grill on my Tacoma."
positive,"Fits my 2011 Suzuki C50T Boulevard just fine with no modification - holes pre drilled to correct size.<br />The C50T has factory installed bags, windshield, and passenger seat back (not aftermarket). Maybe people with after market passenger seat back are having hole sizing issues. Don't get me wrong, I love after market stuff like this Quality Luggage Rack at a reasonable price (local Suzuki Dealer wanted ~$250 for official Suzuki rack - I like this one much better). When you install the rack into the seat back supports you need to align the holes on these thick slabs of steel. Using a drift pin alignment tool (like a long ~10&#34; or more tapered punch) makes this easy to hold one hole in alignment while installing the bolt in other hole, etc. On the C50T the rack mount ears on the rack go between the frame supports and the seat back supports. The seat back supports are threaded for the bolts.<br />I am very happy with this quality luggage rack."
positive,perfect shade for the nsx
negative,It slides up and down on my seat belt.
positive,Bought as a birthday gift and he loved it......original horn on truck was a sissy sound this is just the right decibels
positive,"I plan to carry this on road and mountain bike rides. As I get older the thought of being stuck with a flat 14 miles from the car sounds dreadful. I did a trial run with it this morning on presta valves and didn't even have to read the instructions. Very self explanatory. Power it on, press the cycle button until you get to PSI, hold down the + button to get to the desired pressure, and hit the power button. Just make sure you have a leak-free connection with the presta adaptor and tire valve. Screw it on until you no longer hear hissing. I go by feel so when the tire is firm enough I just power it off myself instead of waiting for it to shut off itself. Fits nicely in the rear pockets of the TSLA short-sleeve jersey I also ordered. I also carry two bottles of sealant with me. One thing...it's pretty loud!"
positive,"This stuff is pretty good, but don't expect miracles after first time use. I own a 2006 Subaru Outback with a manual transmission that was starting to become very slow when starting in 1st gear. Also, while idling, the engine would have noticeable pauses. I was curious about fuel injection treatments, but they can cost up to $70 at the shop. I did some research and decided with this brand after reading many great reviews about it. After putting the Techron in and filling up, the pausing stopped completely and I definitely noticed a positive change while accelerating. I plan to use it again next time I need an oil change as part of regular maintenance."
positive,Works well
positive,Good product
positive,Already used obd at my old job! This is great device simple to use once inserted. Love it
positive,Perfect
positive,I liked that they were easy to install for the most part.  They are small so takes time to get them on but is an easy job after you get a couple started.
positive,We use these all the time in our RV and they work great. We love the scent.<br />Beware: they will explode in very hot weather. We had these in our RV this summer and they exploded. I guess it got too hot inside the RV.
negative,"These lights are brighter than the OEM headlights that came with my 2015 Toyota Tacoma.  The rubber seal that covers the back side of the headlight assembly did not fit with these installed.  It does not seem to cause any problems, but it makes me a little nervous.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Bright, white light for great visibility<br /><br />Cons:<br />High Beam makes very little to no difference!!  In other words, the high beams are useless!!<br />The rubber seal that covers the back side of the headlight assembly did not fit with these installed.<br />The light seems diffused to the extent that I am frequently being flashed as they shine into the eyes of on-coming drivers."
negative,"Finish is very good, fit was perfect and the sound is deep and throaty. Cons are that it's louder than I'd expected (quite loud, actually), and there's not stop tab for the centerstand, only for a side stand, really disappointed about that. They could have made it like the factory pipes with a little longer bracket there for the extra rubber bumper for a centerstand to hit. For the price, it seems it should have had that. I feel a bit cheated. Had to have a bracket fabricated to extend the centerstand stop to mate to where the side stand stop was and then remove the side stand. Had to chose one or the other and no changing tires with a side stand only."
positive,He loved it!
positive,excellent... really cook looking too.  I luv it.
positive,This is far the best one I ever used!
negative,The lens was cracked upon arrival.
positive,Solid construction and fits my xTerra well.  No issues.
positive,"Easy to pop out the pools broken clip and push this new clip in. It is a darker beige the than the original but you can snap on the original cover over the clip. The color difference is really not noticeable. The sun visor is a very snug fit into the clip, but it works just fine. I would definitely recommend this. It's a DYI project for sure.<br />Don't pay dealer prices."
positive,Work well for travel with our pet.
positive,As described
positive,I have bought 2 of these in three months.  Both of them worked and the error sign went away.
negative,Bought a pair I n June 2018.  Lasted about a year and both failed at same time.  Junk.<br /><br />Original  Ford struts lasted me 12 years.
negative,There are no install instructions and it stated it fit our 2022 VW Atlas but it does not.
negative,they are not for 2009 gmc envoy not even close enough
positive,Fit my car perfect
negative,It's hella small
negative,"Garbage.  Just a case, no guts.  What a joke.  If you want one of these, another seller has this for $5 less.  No electronics.  No battery.  Really."
positive,"Great price, easy to install. We bought a bunch, all worked and we ice condition. Didn’t quite match up shape with our old ones."
positive,"These hooks have a decent tension, spring loaded safety latch.  You need to supply your own chain of the proper rating for whatever you're towing.  Having a grade 70 rating, these hooks will way outperform the chain I chose for my utility trailer."
positive,These tire covers exceeded our expectations. The quality of materials is excellent and so is the construction. The fasteners work well and we expect very good service from these.
positive,"Last year I went out on a limb and bought an ASL under hood light. I have been very pleased with it. My handheld Mac tool Light bit the dust and I needed a replacement.  I bought this model the ALS501R I could not be more pleased. It has a very good feel in my hand battery life so far is great has many folding options great magnet,  it can handle a tough shop environment and cleans up very well with just a wet rag with some dawn soap in some hot water.  This is a very High-Quality light, same or even better than the tool truck lights."
positive,It fits very well<br />I’m my RAV4 window.
positive,"Heavy duty, what else is there to say"
positive,For perfectly 👌
negative,"Its been on my HONDA ACCORD V6 EX AUTOMATIC 4 DR for a day now and they do squeak! so and big WTF! but, may be I need to break them in installed with new EBC rotors too. check out pic. Overall they are pretty decent and feel strong when breaking.. I recommend this my friend! UPDATE*****Day 3 of these pads being on, and, my front rims are black with brake dust, I'm a little confused as these pads are supposed to be low dust. It now has the same amount of dust my old pads would give off, after being on for 3 months.<br /><br />[UPDATE 2 weeks later]<br /><br />I've put more than 500 miles on these pads and rotors. They stop well and feel good on the brake pedal, almost feel like rubber bicycle brakes but the stopping power of a car. Bad part is way too much dust. I got punked and have been taken for a ride by EBC. I was looking for low to no dust brake pads but these put out about 70% more brake dust than original HONDA pads. Too much really black oily  brake dust, I'm mad because I spent a whole day removing and painting all 4 calipers red, and I can't even see them.<br /><br />Overall good stopping power TOO much brake dust."
positive,"Nice BMW OEM item. Pretty good price. Will arrive rolled in a BMW box. Place on a flat surface (floor) with heavy books on the four corners, and the mat will lie flat within 24 hours. If you are fuzzy (and, if you own a BMW, you probably are), spills and dripping shopping/grocery bags will eventually stain the trunk carpet, which is not high quality and, thus, very difficult to clean, even if you can."
positive,"We have two sets of steps on our trailer.  I put two of these on the main steps a few years ago, and they have held up well. We decided to do the second set of steps because we are using both more often the last year or so.  The new ones still match the older ones pretty well."
negative,"I wouldn’t normally take the time to write a review on a small item such as this, but this squeegee is so over priced, and horribly designed, that I felt the need to warn people so as not to waste their money!  I assumed, for the price, that it would be better then the $4 Walmart version- very wrong.  The foam netting part is no better then the cheaper version, but the real annoying part is the fact that the head comes loose every time you take a swipe.  I am going to trash this item and call it a loss."
positive,"Required this socket to change oil on 2009 chevy. I was unable to access the oil filter without the socket. Previous to this purchase, I would strip the rubber trying to gain access to the oil filter."
positive,These are a lot stronger and durable than they look in the picture.
positive,Product fit perfectly!
positive,Works great
positive,This is exactly what I was looking for and I was able to do what I wanted. I would recommend this product
positive,"5'10"", 170lbs. Ordered large and futs perfectly.  Haven't used it in rain so I don't know.  Perhaps lite rain. Its definitely designed for warmer weather. You can hold it up to the light and see through it. Love how it looks and fits. Not for colder weather. Has decent, non-restrictive armor. Some armor is so hard and stiff I've had to remove it."
positive,"I have a Razer keyboard that has a volume jog wheel that became so unreliable that I stopped using it. After spraying this in, it works as good as new again!<br /><br />In the off chance you're in the market for a mechanical keyboard, stay away from Razer. The firmware issues alone are reason to not even consider them. I have a Razer mouse, however (Balisk X Hyperspeed), and it's pretty great."
positive,Like the OEM product. Well made for a lot less cost compared to locally available mounts.
negative,"Cheap, small, and flimsy"
positive,Placed this mat material under the headliner I installed in my jeep.  I can't really comment on how much it helped because I installed it at the same time as I installed the headliner.  There is no way it hurt and was quick and easy to install.
positive,Buying another one!!! This is awesome! You can stretch and tighten buckles to fit anywhere in the back of my van. Would work well for any van or suv.
positive,"Good value, about as cheap as fram filters, matches my oil brand"
positive,"This my third air compressor and it looks like my last for some time.The first two brands were a victor air compressor and a slime brand which was the worse from the two is was made  cheap made of  plastic and vibrates like and old drier, the victor was slighty better than the slime but canot copare to the viair power or the materias is made of don't let the small size full you.I will definitely buy from sellers again."
negative,"The mat was used instead of new! The mat was shipped to my home on the box and with a plastic wrapping, however, when I extend the mat on my car, was full of stains, yellow scratches, and the rubber all over the mat seems to be old and faded. Immediately I put it back into the box and ask for my refund."
positive,Cheap. Good. Actually I've only used the yellow on a regular basis as I can wear them day or night. It is odd that sometimes I can remove the yellow glasses and realize how dull looking a day it is.<br /><br />Good protection behind a windshield. Good visibility in the periphery. Odd nose piece. I'll be buying more of these than the expensive Wx glasses I've been using.
positive,"I took them apart to inspect.<br />Appear they'll work, but they SURE didn't clean them after machining."
positive,Great
positive,"The dome and mechanism are about what you'd expect for the money. It will probably last 3 or 4 years unless you live in a hot, dry area. The fan is junk. The motor is noisy and the fan blades fell off after a few uses. It's about what you'd expect for the price. Look around on Amazon for a 3000 rpm 12 volt motor. You can find one with real bearings for around $20. You might be able to use the fan blades on the new motor. If not, make sure the replacement blades fit in the vent area."
positive,"It seems to work a little, not as much as I hoped. I followed the instructions to a T and didn't get any smoke, so either my engine is really clean for 108K miles or this wasn't doing the job. Either way, I'm sure it didn't hurt. First 2 cans received were very damaged and dented, Amazon replaced them with 2 more (free of charge) and shipped them with adequate packing."
positive,"great part,good price"
positive,"great kit, easy to install.  I ordered this one thinking it was correct for my diesel 2015 F250, it's not but that's my mistake.  I ordered the correct one and it's great."
positive,Nice Land Rover Range Rover mats.
positive,Exactly as described
positive,They were very easy to install.  The replacement lifts really made it easy to lift and close the heavy tailgate.
positive,"These should have been included with the V&H Short Shots to be honest.<br /><br />I initially installed the Short Shots on my V Star 650, far too loud. Ear split-tingly loud without baffles. It also performed terribly because of the lack of back pressure. The bike was almost un-rideable.<br /><br />I ordered two of these (One for each pipe). Once I managed to finally remove the stock &#34;baffles&#34; and installed these, performance was perfect and the sound was just right. Still loud, but not stupid loud. If you're into loud bikes that perform poorly, don't buy these."
positive,"I have tested over a week, keeping even ice cream frozen in Texas weather, mind you not in Texas summer yet, but a few 80 degree days. I did have something set wrong and it drained the car battery after 4 days, so that is on me.  There is battery protection built in, I just didn't have it set.  I was kind of curious to see how long it would take. Very nice clamps to keep the lids closed, travels well staying in place, great additional seating or table when the vehicle is stopped. Single compartment can be used when grocery items are low. I am very happy with this purchase."
positive,"It works really well, just a few swipes and my paint was smooth again. The only downside was I ran out of the detailing spray before I ran out of car."
positive,"Everything fits perfectly on our 2019 Honda Ridgeline,"
positive,I put this on my Lexus Is350 and it blends in well with the factory trim like it came with it.
positive,"Nice heavy matt, good looking, strong plastic odor, hope it goes away soon."
positive,Truck runs great
positive,"Works fine,  they need to be smaller diameter to fit into modern vehicles  ! Will not , P.I.T.A. - Automatic shut-off is pretty useless when you need to stand there and hold it because it doesn't fit in the filler tube inlet !!! -  but it works"
negative,"Why would anyone make an oil drain pan with a spout that is flush with the top rim?  That's not a spout.  Unless you pour the oil out of this thing at a ridiculously slow rate, the oil just flows over the sides and misses whatever you are trying to pour the oil into.<br /><br />This thing is going straight into the trash."
positive,"Sweet little air compressor. I carry in my back pack on long bike rides. Just in case, but the kids have used it to blow up floaties and basketballs. Definitely glad to have this little gadget for everyday needs. Souvh simpler than relying on a big ole one that I need help with."
positive,Been using it for years. Terrific product!
positive,Excellent quality.  Used for 1993 Chevy P30 chassis RV.  Fit and works with OE cap. Re-drilled mounting holes and capped lower hose barb.<br /><br />Easy fix for cracked tank that isn’t available.
negative,This is not an Atwood product.  it is a Dometic product and not the quality of Atwood.  On/off switch is extermely difficult to use and clearly will break after a few uses.  Very poor quality and should not be sold as Atwood.  Shame on Amazon!
positive,These keep things like your keys etc from falling between the seat and console .  Try them you will like them
positive,Sturdy and only one hand to get the phone on it
positive,Perfect and half the price
positive,A little hard for a woman to install.
positive,"I put this kit in a customer's truck and it fit perfectly into the truck and the color was a perfect match.  Seriously, this kit looked better than the OEM bezel.  I was impressed, but my customer was ecstatic.  Definitely worth it."
negative,Nice radiator but the transmission fittings were wrong and I had to use the ones from my old radiator
negative,"I brought the sign a few weeks ago, after one car wash the sticker was gone. I see why it comes with 2. I don't recommend this product. It s expensive for nothing."
positive,"I laid all of these in on top of the existing carpet mats and it's cut so precise, there are no gaps, it's awesome. I'm definitely impressed with this product."
positive,Must have
positive,"It is great in my classroom for cleaning hands and faces.  Some of my students need assistance in maintaining a clean appearance.  These are quick and do the job.  If I am cleaning my tables and such, I do that with heavier paper towels and a cleaning product.  But for a fast, water only, cleaning tool....this works just fine."
positive,"I like the grip on Fram filters, makes it so much easier to remove when it is time.  I have used Fram filters for years with no problems."
positive,"Bought a cat back exhaust system that came with u-bolt design exhaust clamps.  The u-bolt clamps do not hold a seal and pipes could still move (rattling against heat shield, etc).  Replaced with these clamps and the connections are rock solid, no more twisting, solid seal.  Very well made, happy with the product!  The exhaust vendor should include these with their kit..."
positive,"When you purchase, make sure it says ""Briggs and Stratton Store"" which is done through Amazon.<br /><br />Referencing your engine manual, this is parts 590601 & 590602 which includes the foam pre-filter.<br /><br />Perfect fit on the 9.5 GT (B&S Model 130000) that comes on the DR Chipper/Shredder (Generac)"
positive,"Neighbors’ umbrella blew into our truck and scratched along the whole side and tailgate! Of course they didn’t have insurance, so I decided to DIY it. Got rid of about 85% of all the marks, leaving just the very deep ones although they were still less visible afterwards. I’m extremely pleased with the result, especially at such an affordable cost! I’ll buy again if I ever need it!"
positive,[[VIDEOID:d25e02e9e154bf10eb57ef492a4213cf]] Nice hose bag<br /><br />It has a spot for everything !  My neighbor has a RV and he loved this.  Helps keep all his stuff much more organized and clean.
positive,My car
positive,Good Deal Fast Shipping A++++++++++
positive,Always dependable to get rid of scuffs and restore gloss.
positive,"Excellent quality, best pair i’ve owned yet. Leather is soft yet tough. knuckles feel like they were molded from my hands. Super grippy"
positive,Works excellent
positive,Glad I got this.  Fits my windshield much better than the previous one I bought a couple years ago at an auto parts store.  Also keeps the car noticeable cooler than the poorly fitting one.  Otherwise not much to say.
positive,"I love this thing more then I should, and I'll admit it's really because the coin holder portion creates a lil hidden pocket for small items to be stowed away"
positive,"So easy to use!  Collapses easily with a twist and stores in its sleeve.  Material is thin but the difference in temperatures is amazing!  I have an Acura MDX and it just fits the window, anything larger and you would need a larger shield."
positive,"Product came sooner than quoted. It was neatly rolled, put in a plastic sleeve, and shipped in a heavy duty cardboard tube. The edges are intact. I have not applied it yet however so far so good. I will update my review in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Great product; I can definitely see how easy it is to work with. I unfortunately didn’t have a much needed second pair of hands for my level of expertise and the size I was working with and ruined my install by an inch."
positive,My third brake light had begun to stop working so I found this replacement and it works perfectly. Watched a video on youtube to help and had it done in a little less than an hour.
positive,Good item. Painted well. Installer said better than most.
positive,GOOD
negative,2003 ford windstar didn’t match
positive,"This net stretches perfectly to hold 3 full size suit cases, keeping them from sliding around the bed while driving and also keeping them at the tailgate area for easy unloading.<br />You will need a pair of carabiners to use as the net has loops, and truck beds have loops / bull rings."
positive,Perfect fit on 05 Colorado
positive,Works great! No complaints. Recommend for sure.
positive,The oil-change place tried to charge me $40 for a cabin air filter. I did some research. This one had great reviews and they were correct. The installation took about 2 minutes for less than 1/4 of the price quoted during my oil change. The scent is nice as well--very subtle but keeps the AC smelling fresh.
positive,"These fit my 2001 Ultra Classic perfectly. Were easy to install and really add a nice look to the dash. Just installed a few days ago and really pressed and repressed many times to make sure they hopefully stick. I gave adhesion a 3 star as I just don't know at this time if the double faced tape will hold with the vibration? if it does not work, plan B will be some small dots of epoxy.  Great look for not a bad price."
positive,"Cross referenced the serial number on the original receiver, and it was a perfect match. All my locks were fine, but bought the car recently - NO REMOTES. So, I priced them out. With all the aftermarket ones getting negative reviews, decided to get the entire kit. For the transmitters/receiver, it didn't cost that much more.<br /><br />The box and instructions state its for a CR-V, but it worked with my Element just fine. I would imagine any 03-11 Honda that has a regular immobilizer key would be compatible.<br /><br />Took about a minute and a half to replace/install the new one. And the remotes didn't even need programming. Works great! Only problem I'm having is figuring out how to get the doors to auto lock after accelerating past 10mph - like most Hondas. But this is a much needed uprgrade."
positive,"I bought this adapter to install a truck bed extender for carrying 4' x 8' sheets behind my SUV, which will accept such sheets into my vehicle but only so far.  The holes line up fine.  And one doesn't need a new machine bolt to attach it; just use the same one that was previously used, for example, with a bike rack.  Very pleased.  And...I got it totally cheaper than at the well-known ""Freight"" store."
positive,"I’m kinda taking everyone’s word for it that it’s awesome. I haven’t noticed a difference in mileage, but definitely starting smoother and a smoother idle. So, I’m a fan."
negative,"Super easy to put on, looks fine, but the reception is terrible not even worth trying to listen to the radio. If you want it just for aesthetics it would be perfect"
positive,"It works great on my Simplicity Garden Tractor. Its so easy to use. Not all of my trailers, leaf rake, lawn roller, etc have the ball hitch on them. Just pull the pin and turn it over for the hitch that uses a pin. The hook is great for the tow strap when pulling small trees out of the woods.<br />It's built Very Well!!! Great deal for $34.88."
negative,Returned. Didn’t work
positive,just wish it was stainless to use on the boat
positive,"Work great, keeps 11 y/o snow blower going on 1st or 2nd pull"
positive,Product was easy install
positive,Extra shine is what you want Buy this!
positive,"There were barely any instructions and it was such a pain to get on.  The description said it fit my car, but it didn't.  It was too big and not enough spaces for the seat belt latches.  However, once they were put on well enough, they are super comfortable."
negative,Used this on my boots but it darkened them way too much for me. I was very disappointed.
positive,Exact replacement and fit. Very easy to install. Watch a YouTube video and you can do anything
positive,Highly recommend these. They fit our 2015 Ford Edge perfectly and I have them for my other car as well.  Great American made product.
positive,Fits as advertised.  Used on a 2008 Chevrolet Impala
negative,"Even with greasing the threads as I turned the bolt, they started to strip as I tried to remove a lawn mower blade adapter from the shaft. To be fair, adapter had not ben removed for 13 years, maybe the tool is OK for lighter jobs. Could not remove the adapter."
positive,Just like OEM. I threw away the annoying security lugs that vw uses.
negative,"Not The Best lighting, wish was brighter"
positive,It filters oil in my 911. What more can i ask for?
positive,I used this to DIY grill wrap on a Honda Crosstour EXL 2014
positive,Do not be fooled by the 1.5 CFM. This pump had my new A/C system down to 29HG in no time and held it there as needed. Read the directions and follow them my pump worked perfectly.
positive,Great
positive,"Great big clear gauge, my favorite inflator.  Even works on motorcycle tires, very accurate readings, Looks very well made, should last for a few years."
positive,Fixed the horrible start up/shut down vibration on my 04 Chevy trailblazer with the 4.2l and still working great after 3000 miles. Purchase a passenger side motor mount heat shield before starting this project because they are very hard to find.
positive,Got this battery as a replacement for a dead one in a child's electric car. Fit perfectly and powered up immediately. Holds a charge well and works with the original charger. Good value for the money and brought our grand daughter's ride back to life. A win.
positive,Looks good on car.
positive,Both of my adult sons love theirs!
positive,Excellent tool to get the used oil outta the engine.
positive,"I wish I had thought of this. It's an excellent product, well-made, and easy to use.it's ridiculously easy to use and made America as well."
positive,Bought this as a stocking stuffer for my husband.  Cute!  He has it on his bowling bag.
positive,This fits my 2008 CLK350 without any issues.  These are the second set I've used on my car.  The previous ones lasted 3 years.
positive,Heavy Metal Solid Piece. Easy to install.<br />FYI- The eyes don’t light up it’s only the glow if any from your starters button.
positive,Stuff works great
negative,this product is not 700 watts it is 200 watts i had it checked at a shop for the amps and watts.  junk and not worth the money
positive,"I like this thing a little more that I thought I would. It is simple and inexpensive chrome plated plastic. One good whack from almost anything would take it out, but it works great and looks pretty good, especially at night. A fun novelty for your Dodge Ram. You just need the 4-prong trailer light harness to connect it and the 2&#34; square trailer hitch."
positive,Well made
positive,"Great, bright light for daytime driving. Not an easy install for late model Tahoe/Suburban."
positive,great step bar
positive,"Fits exactly like I expected, installation was very easy once you remove old ones by pulling clips , then just pop the new ones on simple 🙂."
negative,Working great so far.  Had it in a few months now. **Update**  Starter no longer works!! Had to get the car towed yesterday.  Lasted 3 months. I knew this price was too good to be true.
positive,"I replaced all the &#34;Marker Lights&#34; on our Montana Fifth Wheel. These lights are well made and super bright. Easy plug and play, just make sure you have them inserted correctly. If they don't turn on, rotate 90 degrees. Only work if plugged in correctly. I am very pleased with the purchase."
positive,Perfect!
positive,"Perfect fit.  I bought a used, 2004 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT and the passenger door had a lot of wind noise while at highway speeds.  It also leaked when it rained.  Casual inspection of the existing seal didn't show any holes or anything.<br /><br />Ordered this, pulled the old one off and installed this one (no tools needed).  Truck still has a little bit of wind noise but not nearly as bad and from what I read, is SOP for this truck.  No more leaks either.  Good product."
positive,"Fits great, looks like new, works like orginal"
negative,Product was a little difficult to fold back up but had to return it becuase it was too big for my windshield (even though it said it was compatible for my vehicle).
positive,As described.
positive,"Some reviews of this product and similar ones from other brands suggest replacing the grease fittings with 45 degree angles to allow easier fitment of the grease gun nozzle after installation.  I did this for the driver's side (first to go in) but upon close inspection it appears to be unnecessary.  On the passenger side I left the straight grease fitting in place and ran with it.  There is just a bit of bind when installing the grease gun nozzle but it is still easy enough to wiggle on and off.<br /><br />I don't know if there is a difference between the right and left sides of the axle housing, but the driver's side was extremely difficult to install and get seated, yet the passenger side just falls into place!  Also, the unit installed on the passenger side appears a little bit deformed on the inner surface - it is not round.  This caused a bind on the axle shaft.  Combined with the loose fit inside the axle housing, as the axle shaft rotates it will also rotate this dust seal until the grease fitting stops it from turning any further - there is about 1/4 free rotation total on the passenger side but the driver's side is a firm fit.<br /><br />Overall I really like this product.  This is soooo much better than the little plastic cap Dana used.  This should be an OEM part."
positive,"Have used it to premix in a mazda RX8 for years.  Legendary Racing Beat recommends it, so it must work well for rotary engines.<br /><br />Of course, the only way to know if a premix works well in a rotary engine is through a full engine tear down.  This allows you to see the wear patterns of the apex seals, from which you can determine if the premix is really doing anything worthwhile.  But premixing doesn't really hurt anything - as long as you are using the right amounts...so why not use it as secondary insurance?<br /><br />Another note...Royal Purple is one of the few (if not the only one) premix I've found that claims to be completely ashless.  To me, that alone justifies the rather expensive price of the oil."
positive,looks cool my daughter loves it only complaint is no wind resistance it bends the antenna while driving
positive,Got these for my Honda CTX700 motorcycle.  They are really helpful in determining if an auto is coming up beside you.  They leave plenty of room on my bike's mirrors for a normal view and are very clear.
negative,Not very accurate. Wouldn't recommend.
positive,1999 Mazda Miata 1.8L<br /><br />Had a check engine light on.  Code says it was in the catalyst system (emissions and catalytic convertor).<br />I believe this O2 sensor can be installed up or down stream.  I installed it upstream (first O2 on the exhaust pipe).  No more engine check light on.
negative,"Really a perfectly designed product for my old Acura that doesn't have a drink holder...but the faux leather wrap started coming off within one or two uses. So, it does the job well, but looks kind of ratty, pretty quickly."
positive,"Great material, straps seem well made."
positive,"I didn't do a good job applying, but that's my fault. Color was perfect. Instructions were good."
negative,Went together good enough. One side was warped but worked. Then as soon as I adjusted my light hight the tabs that hold the light in broke on the warped one. Don't feel like the hassles of a return just ordered another brand
positive,I ordered this for my Kia Sorento.  It fits nice and looks great!
positive,These wipers were of great quality and installation was quick and easy
positive,good
positive,"Great, got em for my Dad for Father’s Day and he loves them"
positive,There was no tool included. Hard to get over plate. Stopped rattle noise when closing rear hatch. Hope it helps protect paint. Something similar should come with $40k car. Would be nice if there was something stiff with rubber back that plate just slides in from top. A hybrid idea.
positive,This is a good product  but too big for my key. It is a great product and nice leather.
positive,[[VIDEOID:f0213b69de2bd126e9696a1929bbad02]] Amazing little vacuum - the suction is great - used it to vacuum up my car carpets and my couch - love it
positive,"Well made and a must have item to back flush your tanks.  Dump the tank, then refill through this cap being careful not to overfill, then dump the tank again.  Do this each time at least once if possible.  Some rvs will come with this type of cap and some don't."
positive,The mileage between treatments varies on the road and weather conditions. Excellent product.
positive,Perfect replacement mirror. Arrived nicely wrapped and damage free.
positive,Everything works as intended great product and you get everything that was in the description. It works as advertised and very cheap too.
negative,For front door of a 4 door. Does not work for a 2 door.
positive,Worked great.  Came with everything needed and I believe has solved my problem. Way cheaper than the genuine Nissan part
positive,"Heard clicking on rear of expedition. Temperature wouldn't change, heat stayed on in rear. If that's your problem, this will fix it. If the a/c won't switch from floor to ceiling vents, then the problem is the other actuator."
positive,"Driving is boring and when your sitting in traffic, if I can make one person smile by having a funny window sticker it is worth the purchase."
positive,This heated hose got me through the last cold spell in my RV trailer and is easy to install/set up.  Bought a length of the split hose insulation and cut to fit both ends (faucet & city water).  Been in the 20's and has held up well.
negative,fittings are cheap
positive,"One of the best products I've purchased simply because it performs the exact way as described. Ease of use and indicators communicating the process were perfect. Quick and exact reports sent via email for future reference by the car owner is definitely a bonus. I highly recommend this small but perfect device for anyone who wants to know what the experts see and have piece-of-mind that they professional is relaying the correct information to you, the car owner."
positive,"I do really love this Nikola Tesla ""Rectangle Sticker Rectangle Bumper Sticker Car Decal"" --- as I've demonstrated by ordering it 7 times! However, I have requested instructions on how to use it as a decal and have yet to receive any. In my first attempt to ""lift-off"" the top layer, I found out that it doesn't lift off.<br />I still find this to be one of the best representations of Nikola Tesla's best portraiture!<br />P.S. Cafe Press, is it really a decal or not?"
positive,Have not actually tried it but it's ready to go!  Seems well made and easy to use. Nice and compact.
negative,"For the price I really thought this came as a set because most the others were half this price, it seemed double the price would be double the item, as in a set.  So it's way over priced to be just 1 for the money.  It seems sturdy and hooks to the car ok but it's heavy and bulky, doesn't fit in door pocket very good.  Buyer beware I guess, should have read the small print better.  I'll go buy a cheaper one for half the cost to make myself a set one for each side of the car."
positive,"Ive been using BG stop squael for a while, really works used it on all brake jobes ive done on my car. The way it works is that get a pie pan or something that you dont care putting the liquid in, then you take the brake, part the friction side that goes against the rotor, then you take the brake pad and evenly coat the friction side of the brake pad by dipping the pads surface allowing the liquid to even coat/soak into the pad material."
negative,"This device failed after one year. Charger showed an error then the screen went completely dead.  will not charge whatsoever. Contacted the company, they asked for pictures. sent pictures of it plugged in showing the error screen. Then asked for a video of everything, from plugging in, to the outlet, to the now blank screen, to showing that the outlet does have power, to plugging in the car, to showing the car's screen... company comes back and is now saying i didn't go back to show the blank screen after i plugged in the car... seriously?! It's one email per day, and always asking for something new. All they are doing is running around the issue and their method is becoming very obvious and purposeful. They are not standing behind their product, do not buy!<br /><br />UPDATE: the company did send a replacement.  I also understand that they did not request the broken product back so they wanted confirmation of the failure.  However after going back and forth with them (at a rate of one communication per day!), I ended up providing them with extensive evidence and video of a completely dead device, and they were still trying to ask for some silly addition. It was then that I posted this review and miraculously they were all of a sudden sending replacement without requiring yet another video.  Maybe coincidence but still poor customer service at best + a product that failed in the first place!"
positive,FLAWLESS ITEM AND DELIVERY
positive,Best bet for the money. Ran over 4000 miles and held my extra helmet on the back seat. A+
positive,"I added this throttle to the handlebars of my Diamondback 26"" Mountain bike. Installed the cable to a 2 cycle weed eater motor that is mounted to turn the rear wheel. Am able to hit speeds of 35-40mph and can adjust to lower with the adjusting screw. Works awesome!!!"
positive,exactly as described...1 hour to install both..look great.
positive,"It's great it has the following: light, battery pack, jump cables, phone charger, tire pressure gage, and its portable.  It has saved us from waiting on AAA or another agency help assist us with our vehicles. Especially in need of a quick jump only! It has weight to it but worth the price and value every bit. Everyone should have this!"
positive,"I bought these to upgrade the factory HID bulbs in my 2018  BMW X5.  The factory bulbs were more of a 4300K color and looked yellowish, especially against the white LED ""angel eye"" trim and the fog lights.  I had purchased a different brand of these and D1s bulbs they did not fit because the mounting plate was too thick to twist-lock into the car's headlight housing.  These worked perfects.  It took all of five minutes to install them.  The light output and color are perfect."
positive,Easy install and big difference over stock headlights.  Bit pricey but has a great warranty so not concern about any issues with them.
positive,works
positive,"Fit great, great quality and easy to install"
positive,worked great in a 2002 Mazda Protege
positive,Only thing left was the actual scratch where paint was removed.  Took about 20 mins.  Also easily took off some little scuff marks I had around the car.
positive,"Had to remove the metal clips from the original cover, but at least the instructions were clear about it. Relocating the compass without unplugging it was a little difficult. If you unplug the compass, you have to calibrate it. Two Phillips screws hold it on the bottom side. Took about 15 minutes to install."
positive,"Haven't had a chance to install yet, but looks like a nice carburetor, super fast shipping. Will update later"
positive,Wife loves them !
positive,For rv retirement
positive,"Well made hitch, had it installed by a company that sells and installs hitches, was not easy to put on. Installer actually said it was best to just remove the bumper of which he did but said it was a very tight fit, required a few blows with a rubber hammer!"
positive,"I installed this on my 79 Jeep CJ7 4.2ltr. Installation was a breeze, and is performing flawlessly. Installed 3 months ago, still doing its job."
positive,"I had some concerns prior to receiving these keys. With excellent and fast shipping, they arrived before the scheduled arrival date. The fit my L2501 Kubota Tractor like a charm ... fit perfect, started right up. I couldn't be happier. Put them on my spare key rings. Many thanks."
positive,Super easy to install (save your bulb from old one if working as not included) and a lot cheaper than bringing it in to be done at a dealership
positive,Mounted well under the hood of my van.  Haven't had a chance to try them but can't see how they wouldn't work as advertised.
positive,Wish it had more options but great to charge a loose battery or jump
negative,"Suction tube to short by 1.5"". Discharge hose too short. Threads on pump to loose to tighten to average gear oil containers. The combination makes for a messy job. Avoid this junk. It did pump, but that's it."
positive,Works Great
positive,Installed and they work great.  Autospecialty/Powerstop is now my go to brand for replacement brake pads and rotors.  Can beat them and I have had better results with this brand than the OEM replacements I have tried.
positive,"Frequently bought together? Yea right. Smoked lens, yea right.  Way off. These things are an eye sore on the front and rear of the bike. Now I have to tint them with some spray. Smoke colored,  how about fog colored..."
positive,"Got car back from shop, can't tell the difference from the original factory cover. Time will tell."
positive,"I got these lights for the back seat passengers in my 1996 Ford Bronco. I drilled holes in the trim and mounted them flush, at angles which allowed nearly complete illumination from all directions.<br /><br />The light output is perfect. They aren’t too bright to be on while the vehicle is in motion but they’re plenty bright enough for someone to do a crossword puzzle. I plan to install a couple in my rear bumper to add to take away some of the discoloration seen in the back-up camera. I can’t speak to their longevity because I’ve only had them installed for a short time and they aren’t exposed to weather.<br /><br />If, *if*, I had a complaint, it’d be that the wire is too thin. It doesn’t matter much if you cut and solder them to some 16ga speakerwire."
positive,Works great....
positive,work much better than standard automotive hose clamps.
positive,Installed on an 87 Jeep 2.5L couple months ago. No issues.
positive,Steering wheel cover fitted nice
negative,"*UPDATE*  the package ended up at my apartment,,, however all that was in the package was the steering wheel cover, a small bag containing a larger bag?? Like what... so it’s being returned and I want my money back... makes no sense... the heck am I suppose to do with a black bag. If I could rate a minus star I would"
positive,"I was looking forward to having one less key jingling on my ring but finding a place to cut the key itself has proven difficult. The FOB works great and the release for the key works great, but it's just an extra brick on the ring without being able to actually use the key."
positive,Very easy to install and once it's tightened<br />on there it stays tight
positive,"Holds the spare tire securely into place as it should.  I haven't had the need to lower the spare at this time, so I may update this review in the future if something were to hang up.  At this point, I am happy with this unit."
positive,"AMAZING!!!!! Easy to put on, easy to take off. Water beads life nothing I've ever used!"
positive,Works great and pretty durable for a piece of paper.
positive,I've bought a couple sets of these type tools in the past. They quickly broke. These are much more stiff and sturdy than my previous sets. These will undoubtedly be much more durable.
positive,Nice pad for use on the DA polisher tool.
positive,"Vagabond Motorsports has the best fender eliminators that don't require permanent modification. Great quality, fit and finish. This was my first and only choice for my 2017 R6. Looks awesome on this bike!"
positive,I love my license plate cover. Looks amazing on my car
positive,"I find it easiest to slide the bottom in place tucked between to glaas and dash, then lift the top up.<br /><br />Read some complaints about where to put it when not in use, but fits just right under the back seat.<br /><br />The one issue I have is the carry bag. It has velcro on it and snags the shade as you are putting it away. Would have preferred a draw string or something similar to close up the bag.<br /><br />Other than that is a great product that will last a long time."
positive,"A little flimsy to use, but what isn’t for these? I didn’t find a better substitute honestly."
positive,Nice product. We used this for an outside door that has an enamel paint that is similar to automobiles. The sun and weather had really made our door look sad. We used the various products to buff and shine. Looks perfect and nearly new. I would recommend.
positive,Turned out well
positive,"never know when your gunna need em, glad to have em, hope I never need to use em....good quality"
positive,So nice for wiping off the car and so many other uses.  Love these!!! A+A+A+
positive,Works as intended
positive,Looks like a god product!  And especially for the price..  started my atv right up!
negative,"2/6/2023 update.  Stopped working.  It was slow and now it won't go up or down.  I contacted seller for replacement.  Purchased/delivered 11/29/2023 and the return windows closed on 1/31.  Weather was nice today too.  It had been super cold and wet so didn't really use it during the time I had it.<br /><br />My vehicle is 21 years old.  I have had to replace all but one window regulator.  This one was the second time i've had to replace for this exact window.<br />Motor goes down quick, rolling window fully open. It goes up slow, closing window completely.  it is what it is.<br />You definitely can't beat the price.  I know these replacement parts are more expensive at big box parts dealers and will also fail in a few years.  Just buying time with these.<br /><br />Very easy to install, once you see a good quality video.  The one window regulator that was still original to the vehicle died two days before I replaced this one I just purchased.  I was able to compare the parts to each other.<br /><br />Wouldn't you know it... the exact same piece was broken on both of them!  I had kept all the other window regulators from vehicle, and other similar vehicle, and was able to use some pieces to fix ONE regulator. Not the case this time.<br /><br />The part that breaks is a simple roller guide where one end of the cable pulley connects. They are all made of plastic and take a bulk of the operation stress.<br /><br />The OEM plastic was a bit thicker than the new replacement one.<br /><br />So for less that $50 for the part and your own labor, this is a great fix.  if you have to pay someone... wow, just doesn't feel right.<br /><br />I have personally replaced 10 of these on my own vehicles. Sounds like a lot, but the cars were worth the simple repair.  21 & 15 year old vehicles and this has been the most major repair on them.  Not bad.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon for finding the Old Stock at great prices! Usually at half to 75% off OEM prices."
positive,"I use this on my stained glass projects (after solder but before patina) and it works perfectly. Its SLIGHTLY abrasive, so I find it useful before patina (so that the solder is completely flux free and I think the patina sticks better if recently abraded) rather than after (as I'm afraid it will rub off the patina if I do it after).<br /><br />A little goes a long way so it's good value and it smells nice!"
positive,Works perfectly  ... installed for a few months now.
positive,This is identical to the one that came with the trailer. Only needed the cap part but now i have extra when it needs to be replaced. Exactly as described and went on perfectly when putting it on.
positive,As advertised.
negative,I had purchased the car cover because I was traveling for a few months and I wanted my car to be protected from the elements but after just a few days the light wind blew it off that’s exposing my car to the elements of the winter over the course of several months complete waste of money
positive,Good connectors for car repairs.
positive,Very easy to install and works great!
positive,Good price and work like they should.
positive,"Ordered these for my 93 Blazer , the site said they fit , and they do except I need 4 more , I have 6 lugs."
positive,Worked perfect
negative,"This is an inexpensive way to brighten up an old 1998 Toyota Corella. Even though I was not very satisfied with the lighting quality of the product, it did work and was brighter than the old foggy headlights. I guess because this product is quite inexpensive, some problems are expected. (1) The metal clips that came with the new headlights easily slipped out, especially the clip on the top, and the headlights could not be securely tightened; this happened to both left and right headlights, and I ended up re-using the clips from the old headlight; the clips from the old Toyota headlights were designed not to slip out. (2) Beam angle adjustment was difficult, as the plastic screws were very hard or impossible to turn, maybe because the plastic is not hard enough. (3) The headlight beams were poorly focused; in the pair I got, both left and right headlights were poorly focused, so it seems to be caused by the basic design of the reflectors inside the headlights. Instead of a continuous lighted region, the light beam is splintered as shown in the photos. I give this product 3 stars because it is inexpensive and sort of works, but the light beam focus is not very good."
positive,"By no way can you count this as a negative remark, just a suggestion.  They included the mounting screws which were perfect, the only thing I could suggest that they add to this kit would be the inline wire termination. By doing that this would be the best kit on the market. But please realize that the previous comment by no means takes away from the high rating I gave the product."
negative,These are not a big or cushy as I thought they would be and there is not way to hook them on so they stay put.
positive,Works greeeat!
positive,"I have not yet had need to use these, as they were purchased to keep in the trunk of my work vehicle in case of emergency. They appear to be very sturdily constructed - other jumper cables I have had in the past were flimsy so that the clamp handles actually bent when I squeezed them open all the way, but not these. I like the color coding on the cables, though that's not really necessary since the clamps are color coded, but its still nice to see."
positive,Does the job well
positive,This is just big enough to fit my large truck key as well as a small cab over window lock.  It has a very strong magnet that will hold well on my steel undercarriage.
positive,"I have not used this outfit yet. As try not to ride in the rain. I did try it on and I believe it will be of use on that one day when I have to ride home from work in the rain. I got the Bright Orange and it will be noticed by anyone who is not high, drunk or not looking."
positive,Perfect fit for the Wrangler. I expect it to last a very long time.
positive,"Great product and we’ll made. Only negative is have to route wires and connections so they lay flat. Had to install 3 times due to outside door handle popping out of inside unit. Once I figured out the problem, it was solved and no problems. Unit is pretty heavy and really made. I highly recommend this"
positive,Bueno
negative,Didn't fit/contour the best during install.<br /><br />Poor quality and broke after driving in snow one time. See pictures.
positive,I needed this muffler to further quiet our generator.  I adapted the exhaust from our generator to fit the inlet size and it works like a charm.  Don't know the exact decibels but it lowered them by quite a bit.
negative,The mirror in its clear plastic packaging appears to be foggy. Once opened it is okay.
positive,"It was a little hard to put it on to begin with, but it goes on after a little stretching. It is really cute and looks really good on my jeep!!"
positive,"Always purchase computer sensors from original manufacturer.  Avoid third party especially made in China.  Also never purchase third party or rebuilt, or remanufactured primary system parts like brake hydroboost, master cylinder, power steering pump, alternator.  You will regret it and double your personal labor when you realize you should have purchased new OEM parts.  Take it from a person that works on vehicles a lot as a hobby and someone who don't trust repair shops based on mostly bad experiences."
positive,Good
positive,Comfortable and lightweight
positive,"A review for an oil filter Ok like I'm qualified LOL OK I'll try.<br />Built with a blowout so not to obstruct the oil flow when you step on it, anti drain back, heavy steel body, strong heat resistant gasket, modern filter medium that allows the filter to remove the steel fileings from 25 to &lt; 4 microns know to cause 99% of the wear. Service life is up to 20, 000 miles! Made by us in the USA. What kinda oil are you running though this thing?  0W40 Synthetic with a bypass filter?"
positive,"I bought the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge after I misplaced my beloved old Brookstone dial pressure gauge. This is a real step up.<br /><br />Using this little critter is a joy. The brightly-illuminated dial and nozzle are clearly visible at day, night or in a dim garage. I only lose a whisper of air when pressing it onto a tire valve stem. The readout remains on the screen for 30 seconds; my old dial gauge lost the reading the instant it slipped from the valve stem.<br /><br />Other positives: they delivered it in two days with Amazon Prime. The price is more than reasonable. This gauge has a mufti-function readout some will appreciate (PSI, BAR, KPA, Kg/cm squared). And the jazzy red plastic casing makes it easy to find in a cluttered glove box.<br /><br />Negatives? Just some minor quibbles. You have to unscrew the case to access the batteries, though reviewers say it has a very long battery life. I would like a setting lock so it only displayed PSI. I wouldn't mind a heavier plastic or metal construction, though this looks pretty rugged.<br /><br />At the price, the TEKTON 5941 Digital Tire Gauge is a solid five stars."
positive,Works very well
positive,A bit awkward looking but does the job.
positive,fit right
positive,Perfect
positive,Break one every time i go to the dunes with my paddle tire..
positive,Been using this radiator for a few years now and have had no issues yet.  Very happy.
positive,"Received on time and worked PERFECTLY on my Cayenne!<br />Thanks, Ricardo."
positive,Filters fit well and were easy to install.
positive,Product performs as expected and delivered on time
positive,Great seller & product
positive,This is a great sun shade!  It’s easy to use and fits my CR-V perfectly!  After a couple of times it’s easier to roll up. It keeps my car cool. I would recommend.
negative,No era el correcto
positive,"Work great! I would recommend. However, saying that, it appears that they slid off if not completely snug so it take some adjustment to do this."
positive,"A little on the heavy side.  Was a little too much for my 47 year old, thought I was in good shape, self, but my husband loves this tool.  He said it was perfect.  He said the weight actually contributed to the stability of the whole tool.  Easy to change pads.  Buffs well.  He uses it on his big work truck.  We are owner operators of a small trucking company.  Nice to keep the fleet shiny and looking good.<br /><br />Two thumbs up for this tool and brand."
positive,"A perfect fit and worked great. The shipper was excellent and had no problems. These lights are made very funny because you cannot buy a harness if it's bad. The lens itself cannot be opened up because it's glued shut and therefore if a wire burns out, you have to purchase the whole unit lens, housing, wires and all. It really doesn't make sense with GM did in this case."
negative,"Quality is average, they work perfectly only for first few weeks and then I noticing lines of not-wiped water etc... Same on both of my cars. Not really what I expected from bosch."
positive,"Perfect for use with the Airstream. I did not use the adhesive, since I just set it on the surface."
positive,The best quality replacement battery clamps you can buy for the price.  Very well made and heavy duty.
positive,"Haven;t used it much yet, but in tests it worked quite well and as advertised. Storing it in the Jeep as a way to air up after crawling off road. I am happy with the quality and output of the pump."
positive,"I already have one pretty durable scraper that is lightweight metal and it works very well, but it doesn’t reach as far as I need it to for getting snow off the roof of the car so I thought this would be a great replacement.  I really like this scraper.  It is strong and durable, yet still lightweight and easy to hold.  It was very easy to put together, and it even has the letters A, B, and C on it to help those out who might need it.  I first put it together for the full length and wow!  This scraper is really long which is just what I wanted.  And I don’t see those individual parts coming apart as long as they are fully snapped together.  After removing the extra extension piece you can still extend the shorter length of the scraper by pulling out the extending piece (not shown in the photos).  It’s really all pretty clever.  Even the end where the brush and wiper is can be swiveled and then locked into place at a different angle.  You can squeegee the windows, brush them off, or use the other end to scrape ice.  You also get an extra rubber wiper, storage bag, pair of gloves, and cleaning cloth.  I really like this snow brush a lot!  Anyone who has to deal with snow or ice in the winter should have one of these in their car!"
positive,Great replacement for regular lights that shake around and stop working.
positive,Works as advertised.
positive,"We had some clunking when we towed our small camper and after much searching decided nothing was actually wrong, just normal noise but we didnt like it. This works Very well to stop the noise since it was mainly on speed bumps on starting and stopping."
positive,Excellent at protecting my floor areas. I’m often in and out with dirt and mud. They do a great job covering my floors.
positive,Works perfectly and easy to install.
negative,Got my first one to stick on and then the rest weren’t cut right and wouldn’t stick on for the life of me. Cheaply made and will just stick to a paint protection film instead. Waste of money!!
positive,"Love that there is a tray in the deep storage area. I'm ot digging into ""the pit"" any longer."
positive,"Tri-fold top fits perfect, super easy to install, no tools, no leaks in car wash, highly recommend!"
positive,Good quality and works great
positive,"I think these will work better than the OME ones. you have to remove the old bushing and sleeve to make them work right. Even though on youtube someone say you leave the sleeve. You have to remove the sleeve so the swaybar will fit inside after it is installed.<br />They work great, I pressed them in with a threaded bolt and washers, then tapped it in the rest of the way with a regular hammer. cheap $10 for two bushings for my 97 ford club wagon."
positive,pretty expensive for 2 bushings and insertion tool I didnt need at 29$ for a  1.20 in injection parts.<br /><br />Part was not the same size  or shape... it was much smaller. I  used the sideways insertion method and it was easy to push in... Yukon working again.  Sad design in the first place... just think how easy it would be to leave a bunch of yukons stranded in a parking lot.
negative,"Bought this to use when on the quad bikes. I have a small head and its a tight fit to pass over my head to my neck,  guess it has to be to fit snugly over ones nose.  I don't think it would fit my hubby,  he has a large head.  Haven't used it yet and will update once I've used it."
positive,"Forget reviews that say these do nothing, they still hit a deer.  Hey, nothing's 100%, but I'll tell a true story about deer whistles here:  Back around 2000 or thereabouts, the Farm Bureau Insurance folks in MS started giving these away.  The MS Highway Patrol put them on all their cars, having hit over 300 deer in the previous year.  With these simple devices on their vehicles, the next year they hit something like 3, and those were hit because one or both had come off in car washes.  That made me a believer.  You'll see deer perk up their ears and stand still or move away.  For such a small amount of money, it just can't hurt to have these one, and I have them on everything, including motorcycles.  Once you're over 35 mph, the whistle effect works and you're safer."
positive,"Pretty straight forward replacement, plenty of videos online on how to replace, make sure you mark at least 3 references to align it back up as the installation tool is garbage, tools you'll need a marker, a 5.5mm and a 10mm possibly a step ladder and flashlight. If you have a chirp when your 3.0 kicks down to idle and its not a belt; sounds like its coming from the bellhousing but higher - this is your fix."
positive,just like factory for honda 250 recon quad
positive,Smaller than I thought but works great with my Medala breastpump and fast charge phone adapter.
positive,You get what you pay for. Probably the last set of plug wires you'll ever need to buy. Very high quality. Very impressed. I don't regret spending the extra $$$.
negative,"I bought this to do a 3-step wax on my car, and though it did a great job, I think this is more meant for someone who is detailing 3-4 cars a week. I also noticed that even trying to be extremely careful upon startup, this thing has a really wide startup rotation that flings wax or polish all over the place. And yes, that was with the pad against the car surface before turning it on. 3 months after my intensive wax job, I am still finding flecks of wax and sealant on random parts of my car."
positive,Had to have a pro locksmith install it for $90. Took 2 minutes. Works great— just like the original. Saved about $150 by not buying it and having it installed at the Toyota dealership. Plus AAA reimbursed the locksmith fee.
negative,"Looks great and worked well for about 6 months. Then it started to jam. I oiled it etc but nothing helped. Now it takes a screw driver to open, so it just remains unlocked. I'd remove it but the installation requires you to drive self tapping screws directly in your factory gas enclosure frame. Maybe I can find a replacement lock core that will fit."
positive,"The good part: The fan works very, very well. It is much quieter than my old fan even on the highest setting. It sucks most all of the smells from frying out of the RV. If you put your hand next to the vent outside, you can feel a tremendous amount of air! The LED light is super duper bright on high and nice and low on low.<br /><br />The hard part: Installation. I had to cut my hood out with tin snips and drill out the tach welds. Then repaint parts of it. It took me about 4-5 hours for the install. If you're patient, it is worth the money. I was worried I wouldn't like it, but, I LOVE it! I rate my self as an average tinkerer."
positive,I have wanted a set of these for a while.  There is not much to tell but they work.  As others have said it is hard to figure out what one you need. It can take some time.  However you will eventually find the most common ones you use and have them ready to go.<br /><br />There seem to be a lot of duplicates but that's ok with me.
positive,Thank you
negative,I had made some progress on my scratches light and deep and this made things worse.
positive,fit well
negative,"I agree with all of the reviews that say the bristles are cheap. I have found that these brushes shed and wear out really quickly. Also, I dropped one and it landed on the back of the handle and the handle broke. There are so many options for detailing brushes and I would look elsewhere."
positive,"I bought my Solara with some minor damage on the hood that included a cracked trim piece here. It was held together with tape.<br />I'm really happy to say, I was able to remove it pretty easily and this even came with the replacement bolts to re-assemble it all. I had saved the original hardware in case I needed to reuse it, but it wasn't even necessary. Really happy with this product and my Solara looks like new now!"
positive,"Took it to a local shop, they had it installed and the vehicle ready in less than 30 minutes. Car rides so much smoother now. Will be buying again soon for the driver's side."
positive,Easy installation and works like a charm. An expensive fix for what could have been terrible.
positive,Fit 2007 GMC Sierra perfectly.
positive,I was extremely pleased with this product. It shipped fast and was just what was needed to replace the carburetor on our weed eater.  It was &#34;Plug and play&#34;; Came with everything needed and It took approximately 10 minutes to install.<br />Would highly recommend.
positive,It's what I had to have and they knew it not cheap.
positive,Fit in the stock airbox of my 1991 fzr600 perfectly
positive,Good product from mothers as Always
positive,Part fit great and works great on my 2012 Kia Rio sedan LX
positive,Amazing transformation! Looks like a new car and the lights work great.
positive,Definitely a nice bright upgrade thank you
positive,just like any other booster cables if not better
positive,Very practical for the price!
positive,"Small, powerful, easy to use. Recharge it about once every two months, just in case."
positive,worked fine...went on with no problems and I like the price much better than the cycle shop's price...next time for sure
positive,"It's kind of hard to judge radiator flush. I used it before putting in Kool-It coolant additive. Frankly, it's quite a bit more expensive than the Prestone and Zerex stuff that you can buy locally. Lubegard stuff is decent, the bottle and color is nice!"
positive,Absolutely gorgeous and high quality material!!! 100% worth the money!!!!!
positive,Love it!! Ive had it for 6 months so far still looks great!!
negative,"I saw this and i was blown away by the idea but as it turns out this bulbs DOES NOT work as advertised. I bought H7 ones from Amazon and i installed it very easily this afternoon and i was so excited to try them in the dark, when i did it was just a very bright yellow bulb. Its not bad by any means but it just doesnt look like xenon at all if you have a 3000k old bulb i highly recommend this for you because it will be a very satisfying upgrade but my bulbs are new and already have that 3800k look so this is not worth the money for me. Note: its not that bad it looks cool but its not that white that i was looking for. If you're like me try the Dimond ones from Philips they say its 5000k"
positive,Worked great
positive,Fits my HD FatBob very well.  Great price.
positive,"Looks great, fit the hitch receiver properly.  Only issue was that while the included receiver pin fit properly, the hitch pin holes on one side were slightly smaller than my receiver lock;.  Fortunately I could grind down the receiver lock ever so slightly, so it fit properly."
positive,"VERY tight fit, as it should be. Take the time to install straight and it works great."
negative,We used this on an off white couch to try and remove some stains.  It brought back some luster to it but did nothing for the stains.  Was recommended by the company.
positive,"Have not crash yet, and hope i don't happy Fit Nice !!!"
positive,"I have used Rain-X since they first came out.  Excellent product.  Rain just beads right off, even in REALLY hard rain.  While everyone is using their wipers, I can barely tell it's raining.<br /><br />Just remember that one coating is not 'for life'.  This will need to be reapplied after a few rains, more if you use your wipers, which you likely would in slower speeds.<br /><br />Easy to apply."
positive,"I am satisfied with this repair kit. I bought a really low quality couch about 6 years ago and the leather and vinyl (has both on it) were starting to fall apart in many places. The areas that I have patched with this repair kit seem to be holding up well and I did this repair job a few weeks ago. Since then, I have slept on this couch almost every night. I am a sweaty fat guy so if it holds up for me then it should be fine for you too. I wanted to do a few layers for extra strength and also had a lot of surface area to patch. For these reasons, I ordered a couple of these kits. Because I had multiple kits, I had to mix the colors multiple times. Some mixtures came out better than others but I found that I was able to create a very close match if I was very careful during the mixing process. My only 2 complaints are that you don't get a whole lot of each color but need to buy all of the colors. I wish that I could have just ordered the colors that I actually needed but it still sure beats buying a new couch. My other issue is that it has a slightly sticky feel to it after it drys. Overall, this is a quality product and using it was fairly simple.  I will probably buy it again if any other areas on my couch fall apart."
positive,Perfect for the motorhome. It is exactly what I was needing.
positive,Looked for largest car cover and this seemed to be it.  Fits new Lincoln very well but extremely snug for 55 Dodge sedan
positive,Really to expensive but hubby had yo have it.
positive,"Works well for keeping carpet under the mat clean and dry, I wish the sides were sturdier."
positive,"This is nice for when the top is off in the summer.  I put this on every night for my seats aren’t wet with dew in the morning,  The material was much better quality than I expected and the zipper makes it convenient access when I realize I left something I need in the Jeep.  Would recommend to a friend!!!"
positive,I guess it's fine. I like the fact that it can be easily unstuck and stuck onto another car. Other than that baby is the only one who can give honest review.
positive,Like everything.  Seems to run a tad large
positive,Awesome
positive,"This is a great idea for small spot fixing. Only issue is that the instructions did not show clearly how to open and that it opens from both ends. Still if that was the only flaw, it's worked great for the rock chips I had."
positive,make sure you double check the gap!!!
positive,"These are very good quality, nice weight. Locking nut is a bonus!"
positive,"I have been using this stuff on all my cars for 10+ years and this stuff ROCKS! I bought one of my cars, a daily beater, 10 years ago and have applied probably 10 layers of this polish during the first couple of years and then stopped washing my car. After all, it is my daily beater and it rains as soon as I wash my car. What is the point? Anyways, rain does the job and keeps my WHITE car WHITE. I recently washed the car because I am trading it in for a new car and the paint still had a beautiful shine to it and it looked brand new. This stuff lasts a long time! I have tried other polymer based products but I find this product the best. My other car which is also 10 years old looks gorgeous with a wet look. Highly recommended."
positive,seemed to work distracting birds away from our windows!
positive,"I use this thing everywhere, shower, counter tops, car, ect. Works great for cutting down on the water spots left behind in the shower and makes cleaning my granite counter tops a breeze."
positive,"It's on the second treatment and the black tank oder has subsided somewhat. Time will tell if all the hype is real.<br />Update:  Make sure your wearing a mask when using this product. This is a really fine powder and should you inhale this stuff it's going to be a rough couple of days. Be sure to turn all fans off, especially the exhaust fan. I'll be going back to the liquid stuff!"
negative,pint was dried and hard to get out.
positive,Good price
positive,Perfect for my hood on my truck. It looks durable.
positive,"The toyota dealership would charge me $170 to order this replacement part... and still make me change the internals myself.  It was just a few bucks to order from this seller via Amazon, and took me just a few moments to change the internal components.  Super easy... super fast, and soooo much less expensive."
positive,"good quality , nice warranty , spot on"
negative,Cheap Chinese relays. There’s a reason you’re getting an 8 pack.
positive,"This went in so easily I figured I must be doing it wrong, but to my surprise you really do only need to hook up a couple wires."
positive,"Broke my side view on a trash can. This one installed in 15 minutes with normal tools and looks perfect. Four stars because the mirror distorts the image slightly and the stock one was better. I pried the stock one off of the broken mirror (it was affixed with adhesive) but I was scared to do the same to this new mirror setup in fear of breaking the plastic. The new mirror is passable, but just not quite the quality of the OEM Honda one. I'd purchase again."
positive,Perfect fit for my 2004 sienna LE. Came with new bulbs. Quick plug and play. Great product
positive,This works great on my Chevy express 2500 2016 pulls trailers like noting. The only thing I did not like is that I drop it and the black paint feel off and it was a 2inch drop like a drag.
positive,Very easy to install... just slip ring over plug and it just hangs there waiting until you need to slide the cover over the open end of the plug...it works!
positive,"Bought these for one car 2 years ago, they still work fine, so I bought them for another. Hard to beat."
positive,I needed a 75' fresh water hose and this works but kinks up easily until water pressure is applied and hose unkinked.
positive,"Easy install if you threw Code P0128 - placed in a stupid spot by GM right next to #1 spark plug and hot exhaust manifold, Note this didn’t fix the code and message, took a Thermostat replacement to clear, however was 1 of 3 possible fixes. ECT Sensor, Thermostat, ECT Sensor Connector all are DIY"
positive,"I can definitely tell a difference when using these vs before I got them. I live in Alabama and the summers here can be brutally hot! My van gets a lot of direct sunlight on it all day when I’m at work. I decided to try these shades to see if it might help. I’ve had a single piece car shade years ago but I really like this two piece shade. It takes seconds to put in your window and the shades stay in place. It’s also easy to fold them and put them back into the storage bag, although lots of times, if I know I’m not going anywhere after I get home from work, I just leave them out of the bag in the floorboard of the passenger seat. Since it is two pieces instead of one, they don’t take up a lot of space like one big shade would. They don’t fit my window exactly (not that I expected them to since they are custom made), so some sun gets through but they still help tremendously. The price was also great too!"
positive,Gave my travel trailer a great new look.
positive,Love the bumpers!
positive,I put a can of this in my 4 ton R410a system that was low on Freon and iced up.  Its been good for a month or so now but I will plan to replace the evaporator coil sometime this winter not to press my luck.  Getting the unit to take in the stuff was not as easy as I expected.  There is not pressure in the can so it seems to rely on some back flow of refrigerant into the can to draw out the leak seal compound.  I guess this is how they make it compatible for systems with different refrigerants..
positive,"Great product, side to side sway is gone. Much better than the sheet metal stuffed in the gap.<br />I'm using in a hitch hauler that extends out from the hitch."
positive,Did see a difference in power and gas mileage.
positive,I actually bought for my Harley to cover a chip on front end . Looks great and offers protection as well. Flexible very easy to position while installing. Gr8 quality 3m backing
positive,no leaking no issue. extra pointy tip is very useful.
positive,"The only cover that fit my Chev S10 wheel, even though the dealer ""says"" it is a "" standard "" 16 inch. You know they're nutters when even strong men who wanted to sell a cover couldn't fit it on (or sell it).<br />I had to return an 18 inch cover that was too large and was not stretchy enough to fit.<br />This one is loosely fitting, stretches to avoid extra material flapping, and grips.<br />But mainly I appreciate Happy Starla the seller's courtesy and helpfulness.<br />It might not have fit!<br />The Post Office delayed the shipping so long I wondered what was wrong.<br />It would be nice to have some kind of padding or filler. But it does the job."
positive,Easy too apply but some are peeling. It was good for the first month or so. I cleaned the areas before putting the stickers on for maximum adhesion but I guess I spend more time in my truck than I thought. Lol It's a good quick fix and they give you plenty so you can reapply if needed.
positive,"I have a number of vehicles that get little regular use, from farm equipment to collector cars. I have been looking for a charger like this for a long time. The charger mounted very neatly near the battery on one antique car and looks like it could have been factory installed. Easy to connect without having to move separate battery chargers on and off the shelf. I have had it about a month and if it continues to perform well, I plan on buying several more."
positive,So far two months and no regrets...price is much cheaper then Michelin tires and about as good...time will tell. I would buy tires on Amazon again.
positive,Great tires for the price would definitely recommend them for some thing under $200. I put the tires in the rear going to be ordering two more for the front. Switched brands from a ARTURO Z800 to these NITTO NT42O And though the quality is about the same they stop selling the z800 on Amazon but these NT420 Are great no noise smooth ride a great value for its price
positive,Works good
positive,2004 Thor 231DT trailer and a 2007 36ft Providence diesel pusher motorhome.
positive,"Don't know why we waited so long to purchase this for our 2006 XTerra. The fit is perfect, it looks great and it helps with road noise a lot. I guess only benefit to waiting to purchase it is that it was relatively inexpensive for being a genuine Nissan accessory. As another reviewer said it does come rolled up, but after leaving it in the car the heat helps the backing to relax and after a week it lays perfectly flat for us. Totally recommend."
negative,Bought for a 2016 tundra. Tried for an hour to work it onto wheel with no luck. Put on other car instead but very displeased!
positive,Why in the hell didn't I start changing oil like this years ago?  Changed oil in my pickup in 15 minutes and never had to lay on the ground.  Didn't spill a drop.  It's incredible.  It will also make changing all the fluids in my motorcycle waaaay easier
negative,THIS DOES NOT FIT THE 2007 HONDA CIVIC SI!!! DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU ARE NEEDING FOR THIS CAR!!! THERE IS NO WAY IT IS CUT FOR THIS WINDSHEILD! IT IS WAY TO BIG AROUNF THE MIRROR THEN WAY TO SHORT TO COVER THE ENTIRE WINDSHIELD AND IS JUST THIN FLIMSY CRAP! I CANNOT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME WITH THIS! COVER CRAFT SELLS THE REAL CUSTOM FIT LASER CUT SUNSHADE FOR THIS CAR ON THEIR SITE! ITS $70 BUT WORTH IT IF ITS GONNA FIT AND PROTECT AS IT SHOULD!! JUST BUY THE.M COVER CRAFT AND SAVE SOME TIME AND MONEY!! THEY EVEN OFFER DIFFERENT COLORS!
positive,I put that S*** on everything!
negative,It doesn't replace the air hose at the gas station but it works fine for filling up a tire if you have a little time.
positive,"2013 Ninja 650<br /><br />Fits great.  Doesn't cover turn signals even with a Yoshi fender eliminator kit.  Bags have to sit just as the stock picture shows.<br /><br />Durable, versatile.  Adequate pockets inside.  You do NOT have to cut the stiffeners/placards.  They do fit under a strap in the bottom of the bag (hard to see).  The instructions advise likewise.  The stiffeners seem large until the bags settle a bit.  Don't cut them.<br /><br />These mount well enough that I don't think tire rub is an issue.  A lot of that is due to my bike, though.  Be wary that your experience will vary greatly depending on your bike's physical layout.<br /><br />Cost is reasonable.  Got mine used in great condition from AMZ Outlet.  So a bargain price.<br /><br />Forget about a passenger.  It blocks the rear foot pegs.  No big deal for me, though."
positive,Its perfect for the price. land mine is very solid.
positive,easy to put on the visor. easy to put your glasses in and easy to take it off as well. its sturdy and seems like it will last long.... used it for about a month so far and its going strong.. i just wish it was slimmer but compared to others i think its the best for the buck
positive,"It surprised me just how much difference these made in the stability of my trailer.  I put one under the rear bumper, and one between the front and rear doors, and no more wobble.  They appear to be well constructed, and should last for years."
positive,"Ok, we have very good polisher I know Chemical Guys have my back."
positive,Awesome! Thank you! I like it very much!
positive,many good you bet
positive,I love this unit.  I keep it hooked up whenever I don't intend to use my Ranger for a while.  I love starting up with a battery that's fully charged.  I'm using this on an Optima Yellow Top battery.
negative,Broke in first minutes of use by a certified mechanic
positive,"Living in the cold batteries have a tendency to die when you least expect them. On top of that we have a couple of vehicles that don't get driven as often so we like to have these for our various cars.<br /><br />Luckily it has been a warmer than usual winter so I haven't had to use this to jump my car yet so I will update my review should I need to. However, the rest of the features on this are great. The light is very handy, the air pump worked great for my son's scooter tire (have not tried it on the car tire yet, figures my husband just got the slow leak fixed on his truck).<br /><br />My only complaint is that this is a little heavier and bigger than I would have liked so it will probably go in our truck and I will move our other one to our car. I understand that this is still very light and compact considering all it has to offer but thought it was worth noting."
positive,good and so  much  like it
positive,Like
positive,This is an amazing product.  It has a lot of foam you have to shake the can like spray paint.  I have ordered it  4 different times.  I used it to clean outside fins and used it to clean inside fins.  A little goes a long way.  Rinse well the exterior fins.  It makes the unit blow super cold because of it's amazing ability to clean even the particles of residue from city traffic.  It is simple to use spay a little then shake then spray.  It's a great investment in the longevity of your unit.  I advise all to use it for maximum benifits of cooling capacity.  I was not paid for these words.  I have 3 window units.
positive,This is a great pump.  I bought it primarily for my bike tires. Super easy to use and has a great psi gauge. It automatically shuts off once it reaches the psi you set.
positive,"NOTE: we had to call a couple of different locksmiths before we got one who said they could/would program this fob.  The others all claimed it couldn't be done because we didn't have a factory key.  However, it took the one who could less than one minute.  Works great and my husband is happy to have a 'clicker'."
positive,Fit my Acura RDX 2016 like a glove and buttons align perfectly.
positive,Definitely a task to put in make sure you have the correct tools makes it way easier and a few friends.Took bout 4hrs and some patients but we managed. I definitely like the look of it and for the price it's not a bad deal at all looks like a different jeep.
positive,"We’ve tried just about everything on the market for Black Tank Treatment, this is by far the best product on the market. If you like sewer gas smell, stick with one of the other brands…"
positive,"I replaced my water pump and had to remove everything and somehow a little crack. It must be brittle on the old one and so it was pulling in air and leaking so I bought this. It's exactly perfect fit for the Honda Element and it is highly recommended fraction of the cost of the OEM one, but looks absolutely identical. Definitely recommend it"
positive,The product worked perfectly for my car as told to me
positive,As far as we can tell it has been working well and we have no real complaints.
positive,Great organizational tool for the car. It’s easy to let things pile up in the car where it looks like you’re hoarding but this definitely helps. Plus it folds up nicely when not in use. Thank you for a great product.
negative,annoying. it does't fit a normal tissue box (at least in the USA). Maybe an office size?
negative,Didn't work as great as I hoped. Lots of gunk that did not come off with this product.
positive,"Installed quickly and easily, one thing to note is that the seal (o-ring) isn't included. I re-used the old one with out a problem."
positive,"Great tool, wish I had one sooner"
positive,2016 Toyota Camry LE. Brown grid covers- The front covers work well. The back head rest covers don’t really fit well as the car has non removable head rest and you can really secure the head rest covers. The material quality is good.<br />Move the above to my 2019 tacoma double cab as it matches my interior cover and bought black grid for my Camry.
positive,"Serious car washers should have a set of detail brushes in their arsenal.  Getting into the lug nut areas of wheels, getting the grime out of emblems or doing under hood cleaning are made easier with these brushes.  They seem well made and are holding up well."
positive,"Got this for my 2007 ninja 250. When you look out while riding you can see a little orange at the bottom of a bright white light. Looking at the light at the right angle and it looks a little orange or gold, but really only on low. On high it casts a bright beam that illuminates well."
positive,No issues.  Worked like a charm.  Bike was back and riding in 3 minutes ~
positive,Lover it.
negative,"I see how it's functional but doesn't fit my larger handbag. It solves the problem of what to do with my nag when I have a passenger in my car. But usually I just put my bag on the seat because when I'm seated, I cannot twist my body to put the bag in, because of a back injury. I have to lean over and place the bag in the holder from outside of the car, and that's not optimal for me either, so I really don't use this item much. I can see however, that it could be useful to someone who doesn't have the limitations that I do, but for now it's primarily being used by my granddaughter who keeps her crayons in the little pocket on the back."
negative,You would need far more brightness and thinner lines to be useful... This thing is an absolute gimmick.
positive,Starter worked like a new one. Time will<br />Tell if it holds up. I will let come back and update if it fails to last.
positive,"I have never had my license plates stolen. But I have seen crime movies... it is only a matter of time!<br /><br />However, as unlikely as the theft may be, it is much more unlikely that the thief will have the special tool needed to take these off. So whilst I was not worried about having to replace my plates before, now I feel totally safe knowing that they will not go anywhere.<br /><br />This is a good set. The included tool is strong and doesn't bend out of shape as so many included tools do. All the parts you need to protect your plates are included. A good set for anyone who is security conscious about their vehicle"
positive,These are really nice on my car....I like bling!
positive,I had the 6 spline lug nuts on my 2011 Lancer. Finally misplaced it one day. Searched Amazon and this worked perfectly. Five stars!
positive,"I love these because they have that paw print on them,very easy to use . The price is right an it didn’t take long to be delivered."
positive,Overall a good product. But the side flaps do not zip. This makes it hang rather awkward and doesn't really keep the dogs contained. So good for once in awhile but I'll order a different one for regular use.
positive,"Adore this, and i get a kick out of it when i see someone else with one... started a trend at work. (i bought it for $35)<br /> Also protected my bumper when someone rear-ended me.<br />Metal shaft covering hitch is painted and the weathering it took was not pretty after a few years. Green paint did well and replica pins stayed on.<br />And then it went missing when i moved."
positive,Glad o picked these up as it will save our tv antenna and other things to do with our motorhome!!!
negative,This lock's pins do not fit with Rage Power Sports Hitch Racks as the Receiver Pin Hole is threaded for the screw-in Hitch Pin and Clevis provided with the rack kit.  I'll either bore out the threading or get a small lock to fit through the Hitch Pin clevis hole. I give it a 3 stars because it had been &#34;Frequently Purchased&#34; with the Rage Racks.
positive,Fit perfect. Perfect for the price
positive,I bought this to feel fancy and it worked. Soft leather. Easy to push fob's buttons thru it. No slip.
positive,"After watching my OEM license plate screws start to rust after only a year of ownership (brand new vehicle), I decided to purchase these to fill the cheap gap that the dealerships left.<br /><br />Perfect fit for my Hyundai vehicles, and no more rust stains on my plates! Great buy, exact fit. Highly recommended."
positive,This went together easily and is solid. It’s a good height and comfortable
positive,Nana  loves it!!
positive,I am a retired mechanical designer and I really appreciate a good innovative design and this is definitely that. I honestly haven't used it yet because I just finished lubing my cables using the plastic bag technique and thinking the whole time that there has to be a better way of doing this. So I got on Google and found this unit. As said this is an outstanding design and well made of quality materials. I will update this after using it.
positive,Great
negative,the sensor is not as pictured it is black not green as the picture shows. the ohm reading it showed when tested is infinite. that's what a bad one tests. so is it any good? I don't think so. The reading should be a range depeding on temp out side / or engine. around 20 - 50 ohms. I can't recommend buys.
positive,"I mounted these on a Goldwing Motorcycle, and it really got the attention when it was used, lots better than the beep-beep I was used to."
positive,"Looks great and fits well because it has deeper grooves.  It actually looks like stock, but I had to cut mine to fit 1.5 DIN and couldn't mount my radio so I gave up.  If you have a perfect 2 DIN setup, this may look bone stock, which is good.  I figure, it is a minivan, I'll just put my GPS behind the steering wheel.  Great for custom setups, but as you know or will find out, Toyota was very specific about what you can put in there."
positive,Very easy to install. Worth the money.
positive,My husband says it fit our pickup just fine. Works Great!
positive,Small container though but a little goes a long way.
negative,The blind spot mirrors move too easily.
positive,This helped me pinpoint an oil leak on my Jeep but just remember you need to use UV lighting for this to glow.  Seems a little expensive for the size of the bottle but I was able to get 2 uses out of the bottle.  Once to find the leak and a second to confirm it had been fixed.
positive,Great mirror
positive,very nice thanks
positive,Fits perfectly & good quality
positive,"Not the fastest strongest but so far so good. I did have an issue to where I tripped and pulled the power cord on and it did not power back on after that. So be careful not to drop or bang it around hard. Was able to get a replacement under the 1yr warranty.<br />It is recommended to wait and cool off between use. So basically air up a car tire, rest for 10-15mins, air another tire, cool down etc etc per manufacturer instructions.<br />Fairly spot on to my digital tire gauge.<br />Did have prior issues to where say I have it set to 40psi. I'd air up and it would stop at 38psi. That's where the manufacturer recommended the 10-15min cool down or it'll burn up. It will get HOT"
positive,I cannot tell you how many hitch caps have been lost by taking them off and just sitting them SOMEWHERE! You will never loose this cap because it stays attached to the hitch. Someone came up with a great idea.
positive,Does what it's suppose to do. What else is there to say.
negative,"Fog lights were not compatible for a 2009 Chrysler 300 even though it says it is. The main grill was compatible, but the two fog light grills were not."
positive,Great strong plastic....hangs down lower then the paddle but the hook goes around my mirror much better than the paddle hook does. Very nice....would recommend
positive,Great
positive,spare
positive,"My engine was idling high and my acceleration was sluggish.  Granted, my truck is over 30 years old.  I swapped my spark plugs and wire harness and it helped both issues.  This was a direct fit on my truck and looks great under the hood.  The harness has plenty of length to get from the distributor to the spark plugs without problem.  It is made out of strong, thick rubber coated wiring that holds its shape and can stand up to the heat coming off the engine.  My idle has stopped revving and my acceleration has become more responsive.  An easy, affordable upgrade for my truck that anyone can do on their own vehicle."
positive,Decent quality
positive,Fits great
positive,[[VIDEOID:8529deb98c2a6be11b70cf9f0a1fd4bb]] dents and dings happen.  I got this to help deal with some small ones and make sure that my car stays in decent shape.<br /><br />It seems pretty well equipped.  There are many YouTube videos i plan to watch to ensure I do it correctly.<br /><br />Overall it’s nice and I’ve got high hopes for it
positive,Very happy
positive,I liked the many special functions available on this tool. It is well packaged an feels like a quality product.
negative,"Will not work with Ford vehicles because keys need to have computer chip. No locksmiths will attempt to cut the keys either stating that the ""cheap China keys"" will ruin their machines."
positive,"My Car Keys, there is no key just a fob but with this I can hook it onto my pocketbook and always have it handy, plus I can't leave my pocketbook anywhere."
positive,These work perfectly towards reducing the buzz in my handlebars.  Took care of at least 95% of the aggravating buzz.
positive,"Locking gas cap for capless Ford 2017 Explorer<br /><br />1. Price ($15 6/17/22; or three gallons of $5.15 gas) is right: two-thirds the Ford OEM locking cap.<br />2. Key is double cut-- teeth are on both edges -- meaning you can't insert the key wrong.<br />3. Turning the key to unlock holds the key in the cap, giving you a convenient handle to withdraw the cap.<br />4. Insert cap, turn kay, cap is locked.<br /><br />A local launched his boat in the lake and parked the truck/trailer rig in the parking lot all day.<br /><br />Came back to find the truck drained of gas. Time for a locking gas cap."
positive,2001 F250.  Perfect replacement for the original one that broke.
positive,"Mounted them on my 2006 Acura MDX. Tires are excellent so far. Very quiet, very smooth. Balanced very easily, no vibration of any kind. So far the dry traction and responsiveness was excellent. I went with the T-rated tires for their 90,000 mile estimated life. I am looking forward to seeing how they fare. I've had Sumitomo Ice Edge for two winter seasons on the MDX and they were excellent in Northern Arizona snow and show almost no wear."
positive,"But the physics makes perfect sense and it was cheap...if a decision is cheap enough and it makes you feel good, then - ummm - go ahead and feel good :-)"
positive,Ok
positive,Great product. Definitely worth the cost. Especially because its half the price of the big box sellers.
positive,"17"" HD tubes can be a bit hard to find, I'm using this one in the back of my BMW F800GS and it's working out well. Will probably get another one for the DR650.<br />It's about 2x the tickness of a regular tube, which is what you want for actual offroad use with rocks and roots and such.<br /><br />I've been using IRC tubes all over for years, and have not had an issue."
positive,It's a sponge. Nice quality. Soft. Does what is supposed to do.
positive,"Great product... Dealership worthy, but much less."
positive,small thin and powerful. you can use for push or pull
positive,10 stars if I could. I poped this in my 2014 1.8t passat and instant improvement over the paper filter I can feel the difference between this filter and the stock filter. It revs faster has a throater sound and it now spins tire between 30 and 50 if I mat the gas. I can't blow through the old new filter easy but this I can blow through with ease. My milage also is averaging 42 to 46 from 35-37. I've seen minor. Improvements using these on various cars like my old mustang and my 02 passat but this is the most drastic improvement on any car I have used a k&n on
positive,"Great fit, perfectly protects the two front area's, has even extra protection on the sides of the running board..<br />all you have to do is vacuum or remove the liner and shake outside of the vehicle to remove dirt or debris..."
positive,"I have a Kia Optima XL. Finally a sunscreen that covers the entire windshield from end to end and it doesn't flop over on the sides. It certainly has good suction in those areas. I don't know if I can say that it's easy to fold because they never are, BUT once you get the hang of it, I admit it doesn't take brain or muscle power. It seems to do the job of protecting my car from the scorching sun. I recommend this item."
negative,"favorite scent, but for some reason this order of it went through rather quickly. Smell vanished after a week and a half..."
negative,"total waste off money,using on 2014 amg rims  wont clean it ,even if i brush it, look for somethingelse"
positive,Perfect direct replacement for my 1995 ram 2500 Cummins diesel stock fuel filter since the previous owner gummed up the stock filter sensor and such!
positive,"Well built and luminous dial is a great plus, thanks!"
negative,"The long screws that connects to the starter are too long, so you can't get the spool past the shift lever (it has to get behind it to pull it and engage the starter gear).  This unit looks exactly like my original unit EXCEPT for the longer screws.  You can't swap/replace the screws with the shorter ones, and I ended breaking off one of the screws trying to file it down."
positive,I use this cushion for meditation. It relieves the stress on my lower spine and Coccyx bone.
positive,Look great on the truck!
positive,Product worked exactly as it said it would!
positive,"Bought for an 09 Rhino 700 SE, fit was great and no issues after 6 months of riding."
positive,Great smell
positive,Very solid
positive,This thing really does suck. And I mean that as a huge compliment.  Be sure to warm up transmission oil first !!!
positive,Exactly what I needed for the Driver Side fender well of my 2013 Altima
positive,"Works as intended, great fit!!"
positive,good
positive,"Replaced an unused gauge, took the gauge out and secured it behind the panel, had to modify the supplied bracket that holds the gauge but a cut off wheel made short work, finding wiring to power was the only frustrating part as it needs constant power, ground, keyed power and it has a dimmer mode if you choose, I did not install it as even at night with the numbers blue it was not overwhelming. I’m asking another driver if he wants one in a Peterbilt and will let you know if it gets installed in one of those. Looks good and provided cable was plenty long enough to install, no length modifications to the wiring supplied was needed."
positive,"High quality oem product. Marked Denso, exactly like the factory ones. Fit perfect, work perfect. Thanks!"
positive,"Fits perfectly!! Covers the light bar, so I don't worry as much about rocks and road debris hitting and breaking the lights!!"
positive,It looks nice and fits nice but when opening it up it can easily pop out. I wouldn’t consider it secure when opening and shutting but that being said once it’s closed it doesn’t just fall off or anything.  I don’t regret buying it.
negative,Not like the pic it didn’t come with three rows and the back seat only came with on head rest very very very disappointed
positive,"I really love this it makes grocery shopping so nice! Stays in place when going around a corner, And folds down to make more room . Great price and purchase."
positive,I love these things. They stopped the seatbelt from rubbing on my neck. I've even given two away and now they want to buy some.
positive,"Have used this product every 2 months for 18 years / 278K miles on my SUV's leather seats.  The seats still look brand new, like the day I picked up the SUV from the dealership.  The driver seat leather has some creases from my behind, but has no wear and tear.  It's my commute vehicle so I rarely have passengers.  Highly recommended."
negative,"Fits well, however not enough clamps to secure in place. Went and purchased conduit clams and placed 4 more. The last line of the instruction stated not intended for open trailer transport . Junk"
positive,The tires were sent on time and the right size.
positive,Could use more sizes
positive,Fit my 2005 Mercedes CLK500. They are fine for the regular open position. For the second full up position they are too long. The red button is below the hole so it won't lock. The second position is not used very often so not worth returning. I also like that the regular position is a bit more open since they are longer.<br />Boxi has a set that is 20.67 long. It will work with the second position and is the proper length.
positive,"I don't mind cleaning my car. I know I should do it more often! But cleaning the car is almost fun. Until you get to the wheels.<br />I have never enjoyed cleaning the wheels.<br />With this, well, okay, I still don't enjoy it. But I can do it eright, and I can do it quickly, and that is a lot better than the sponge and hhose pipe!"
positive,Great hat love it another great hat with  flex fit
positive,"I love all Meguiars products and have used them for years.  These wipes give you a deep, lasting shine without all the weird “sticky filminess” that some other products (cough, armor all) leave behind."
positive,Study and easy to instal
positive,"I bought this cover hoping it would be big enough to cover my Triumph Thunderbird. I brought it primarily to keep my bike free from airborne dirt, dust, pollen, etc..  In addition to the basic large size of my motorcycle, I have a full size windshield, a sissy bar back rest w/attached passenger arm rests, a rider back rest, a luggage rack, jumbo saddlebags and two flags mounted on the sissy bar. This cover fits over the whole bike with all the accessories with room to spare... no stretching or excessive tautness anywhere. The only thing you can see is the bottoms of the tires/wheels. There is plenty of extra material to allow me to use the security straps thru the wheels to keep it in place. I also use a heavy Kryptonite chain to fasten it to a fence post... the chain fits thru passthru grommet holes, no problem. I can't say much about the water resistance since I keep my bike under a carport (so no direct rain), but it looks like it should do the trick. I also can't speak to the durability as I've only been using it for a couple months, but it's still looking good (for what that's worth). So far I'm really quite pleased with this cover since it fits without a problem... Recommended if you have a BIG bike to protect."
positive,Perfect illumination
positive,"I've installed several of these on a number of my classic vehicles.  Don't waste your time on those cheapy regulators with the &#34;dial-in&#34; pressure.  They are just not reliable.  For a few bucks more, these units seem to do the job without further maintenance."
positive,I love the product . I have used it on other vehicles and have always gotten and increase in gas mileage on all my vehicles
positive,"I ordered this primarily to collect crumbs as well as being easy to wipe off.  This fits that bill nicely.  It doesn't slide around on my seat and while it doesn't look amazing, it doesn't look crappy either.  I ordered a 2nd one."
positive,"Not an exact match to the original, but good enough to replace the original one with a broken cable. Printed instructions were included in both English, French and Spanish (no pictures) but I decided to look at the procedure in Youtube (easier to see it done). The window is secure and working properly again. The unit came with three screw studs attached, I had to remove them to fit the Mazda setup (uses bolts instead of nuts). Great product overall, just exchange connect and it was ready."
positive,I was able to easily use these and not lose a drop of refrigerant. Seems well made and straight-forward.
negative,"The pulley included is different from product picture. Its diameter is too high, and thus was unable to wrap serpentine belt around it. It also came in contact with the car's chassis, when alternator is set to 'full tension'. Included pulley was also silver in color<br /><br />Alternator weighed over 10 lbs; which i guess is a good sign.<br /><br />Update: Item is defective. Battery light comes up on the dash board when braking to complete stop. I re-installed the old alternator, and problem did not occur.<br /><br />Changing the alternator required removing the cv axle and damper fork."
positive,A very good wax!  Goes on easy and comes off easy with little dust.  Use on all my 6 cars from classic to modern.  Shine lasts several months.
positive,Holds the sockets really well.  Love that there are multiple colors for standard and metric. I have a set of deep 1/2” sockets that it holds securely all the way up to 1 3/4”.
positive,Just what we were looking for!  Very sturdy and makes it much easier to close the screen door on our motorhome when going up the steps inside.
positive,"Mounting on a 2016 Ford Escape: Like the quality and finish, Ford factory rack is set at only 2 cross bar positions which required me to take to my local welder to add 1.5&#34; extension [in the middle] so that the locking blocks center perfectly on the crossbars. I also had him weld the two pieces into on since I have the room to store it as a full size basket. I am debating on having a linex or rhino finish applied for ultimate longevity since I will be using this thing a lot [just bought the car and not getting rid of it anytime soon]. Not the fault of the rack but wish the OEM rack's cross bars were movable like all the other vehicles I have ever owned. I loose-laid the rack on the vehicle and it looks good...not too small and not crazy big, it will make outings easy to be able to put chairs, coolers, etc. up there. We own a full size Dodge Ram too but many times parking it on outings stinks as well as it getting half the gas mileage as the Escape.<br />It was a considerable amount of money more than MANY options out there, Rack Attack is reputable and had a great price through Amazon. Item came new, prefect in the factory box as promised. It is easy to assemble and as I said before super quality that most of the lesser brands just cant match.<br />I tossed the plastic oem fairing and had metal added, also added three chain links as lashing points at frt and rear, lastly had it Rhino coated for durability once all my welding mods were done. At this point it does not look like a Yakima basket...see pix. It should outlast the car though...☺"
negative,100 percent does Not work.  Save your money.
negative,"Well, I just got this in mail and I can tell it's CHEAP. Poor quality and I have no idea how it will stand up to any wind as it's thinner than others I've owned. I will say that its huge and should fit the SUV I own 4Runner, however I am very concerned about ripping and tearing just trying to remove from a partially frozen window. I've got thicker material on my grill cover as this thing is less than half that weight."
positive,I bought these for a 2003 Nissan Frontier. They look and work great. I would definitely buy again if needed!
positive,Great magnetic hold to car. They mold around contours of vehicle! Help people realize that can't pass your slow moving car and then  merge in BETWEEN the car and RV! I feel safer using them!!!!
positive,Excellent antenna and just as powerful as the original BMW antenna.
positive,good parts perfect fitment
positive,Purchased these and the price was GREAT! Paid less than half the price of a single filter for this whole kit and it is exact fit and works perfect
positive,"I had one of these in my Audi already, but it was not detachable. So, when I got my new car, it did not have one. I got this one because I loved having one in my other car. This appears to be pretty good quality. So far, so good. I put stuff within the net organizer that I don't want moving around the back.<br /><br />I recommend this for any organized person."
negative,"Doesn’t fit, too tall by 4mm therefore the housing won’t seal into the fan"
positive,Works great
negative,"its an okay cover, started to fade and turn purple...it does the job other wise."
negative,"Works great, bright light looks fantastic next to xenons of my e39.  The wiring is abit flimsy (not as robust as other under-hood wires) and it does &#34;throw&#34; a &#34;check side light&#34; code.<br /><br />Follow up March 2016:  Downgrading to 3 stars after both stopped working after 10 months.  I'm not sure if its these units or another problem, but I'm not optimistic. If they're truly dead (strange that both would go simultaneously) then I'll downgrade the review further."
positive,"Very bright light bulbs and long life too! Wish they were easier to locate. They last yrs, so far I transfered 2 different sets to 3-4 different cars when selling. I only had one blow in the yrs of using them and its because the assembly leaked water. It blew everything I put in it.  Great bulbs if you can locate them!"
positive,"I already have a two socket in my vehicle, but I have my dash-cam using one and my dash GPS in other. This spare socket will come in handy for charging my cell, using my 12V. fan, or firing-up my Engel fridge freezer."
positive,Looks great. Works great. It makes my 35 year old tractor look cool.
positive,"Used this to clean my leather sofa, made the kids help.  Dont really have anything to compare it to, as this was my first time using leather cleaner before.  Dont have any complaints at all.  Plan on using it again as needed.  Would recommend it."
positive,works great
positive,Easy to install. Fits perfect. Keeps rocks and debris out of my A/C coils and radiator.
negative,"If you’re looking at these you know you’re in a position where these will help keep all wrenches on the table and not in flight across the room. I bought these only needing the smaller set. Unfortunately the diameter of rod used to make them is a little to large and you can’t get the seal to fold enough. I did manage to get them to work by folding the seal and stacking on itself. Hmmm think like a spiral staircase maybe.  It got the job done, but wasn’t like it should be."
positive,"This product looks amazing. Fits great and above all else the seller really stands by their product. Not some cheap knockoff although its price is super affordable. 2 months after ordering, seller checked-in to see how I things were going. They helped me get an even better fit and was willing to go the extra mile. Super impressed.<br /><br />Amazon needs more products and sellers like these."
negative,Love them
positive,Great value for 2015 Accord Hybrid.  Perfect fit and durable.  2nd time I gave bought this companies all weather mats.  They have not disappointed!
positive,"The product works and cleans up brake tarnished tires and rim and look very clean after spraying, brushing and rinsing off.  The Big But here is - the design for the spray nozzle is exactly the same for both in the open position.  They only spray in a stream which doesn't allow the product to fan or spray likes Suds in the pictures above.  I went through at least a third of t a bottle on 4 20"" Rims and was shocked by the time I got to tire number 4 to see the bottle had maybe one and a half more cleanings for $14 a bottle.<br /><br />It came out more like a liquid spray then a suds which would have made the product last multiple cleanings....  Time for a real spray nozzle"
negative,"Dull, low light output. The Hella yellow halogens are much brighter."
positive,Works great and would make a great golfer gift!
negative,This is supposed to fit johnson or evinrude but it does not
positive,We leave our rv fan in the bathroom on pretty much all the time so the motor burns out every so often. This replacement motor fits and works perfectly and arrived quickly!
positive,"This is the 4th gun of this type I have owned and never had a problem, this one was the best!"
positive,"Small compact design, used for deep cycle, motorcycle and lawn equipment applications."
positive,Works will
negative,Smaller than you would think.
positive,This is a great clip.  Small.  Holds tight to visor.  Holds glasses securely.  Perfect.
positive,"Works as described.  It certainly made removing the old hot water heater elements and installing the new hot water heating element much easier.  I would recommend purchasing this. HW elements are too easy to change to have someone else do it for you, so buying one and putting it in your tool box is a good move."
positive,Supports fit and worked perfectly.
positive,Fits my 2011 Camaro nicely
positive,This is the best thing I ever bought works perfectly
positive,Use these in the car for the child. Keeps the sun out of your face and you can still see through them well enough to safely drive. 👌🏻
positive,works
positive,"Looks great, as described."
positive,"Fits my winch.  Seems sturdy, but only time will tell.  I would buy again."
positive,"The material of this bag is thick and sturdy, and the zipper is well sewn. Saying the bag is roomy is an understatement. On the inside, there are pockets galore to hold wrenches, screwdrivers, or any other tools you may need for a roadside emergency. There's a pocket on the outside plenty big enough for a pair of gloves. The attached ring makes it convenient for hanging. It's a good value."
positive,I use this on my E-Bike to hold my phone and light.  Awesome!
positive,"I've been using a plastic Cramp-Buster for a while, and really like the fact that I can loosen my grip on the throttle without having the throttle move when riding on long trips.  I ordered this to match my Kury ISO Grips, so I would have a more uniform look, and a throttle assist that doesn't lose its position like the Cramp Buster (one bump and it spins around).<br /><br />Install was quick and easy... unscrew the 4 screws on the grip end-cap, put the Throttle Boss in place, and replace the end-cap using the included ""longer"" screws.<br /><br />It takes a bit of time to get the Throttle Boss exactly where you want it, but once it is set in the right position, you'll never know it's there!<br /><br />If you have Kury Grips, and frequently ride at a few miles or more at highway speeds (steady throttle position), then you'll really want to pick one of these up... Contoured (larger one) or the Standard (smaller one)... they make for less fatigue, which means you are able to ride longer!"
positive,have to check the minimal size
positive,Purchased for my 2020 CX-5 GTR and it fits perfectly.  I knew the console seemed to be missing something but did not realize what it was until found this while searching for car accessories. Ordered on a whim and so happy that I did.
positive,Product is a bit lighter than I thought but will do nicely for my job.
positive,Excellent
positive,Works as promised
positive,Suspa has been making gas struts for a long time and the price was right for the pair I bought
positive,That a little piece of fabric could make such a big difference?!? Fab!
positive,I was performing a search for a pair of wind resistant ladies sunglasses and came upon these.  They are great.  I love the fact that there is a tinted one and a clear one that I could use when it is not sunny.
positive,So easy to install 5 minutes a side!!!
negative,Didn’t fit my car mirror too big lie the bling design and good price
positive,the brakes we easy to install and they look great
positive,Liked the style. Described correctly. Could use more accurate measurements. Not a one size fits all.
positive,"got some aircraft wire key rings and they kept unscrewing....this solved that problem yes sir ree, yup! yup it did"
negative,Device worked greatvbut the link to the app did not work and the one they gave me did not work with my Galexy Android phone.
positive,The fit was great and they looked good on my Focus
positive,Work for  Cadilac 2006
positive,Protects really well and has pockets for tools
positive,GOOD
positive,"Have been using this stuff years, never let me down.  Be advised once you open it you have a year to use the product."
positive,"Used on my first project to correct a potholed rim. The rubber head burnt when touching the heated aluminum, changed to a metal head and piece of wood cushion the task went well. Now I am driving with no vibration. I don't look forward to use it again soon on my cars, but it is good to have it around when needed. Who knows some other projects that I will have may need a 10 ton push."
positive,I used this in the rear of my patrol vehicle (2016 Expedition)  The velcro on the bottom locks to the carpet and the lid is a nice touch. A+++
positive,"Quality pads with all hardware included, quiet and excellent performance.  Fits a 2011 Hyundai Elantra Limited and other cars as well.<br /><br />I do not write big lengthy reviews for the sake of being wordy, I write short, simple to the point reviews in order to be helpful."
positive,Tough tire should be professionally mounted
positive,Amazing piece for less than $5. Replaces the easy-to-break plastic garbage that comes standard on most trailers.
positive,This is a great product because it will stabilize gas for up to 24 months.  I use it all the time in my equipment and vehicles as it eliminates the affects of alcohol in gas when it must be used plus fights carbon.
positive,Great wax.  it goes on easy even in the sun light  and comes off easy also.  But it leaves a great shine and I know my paint is being protected from<br />the elements
positive,Good stuff
positive,Installed on a 98 Corolla VE. Looks like the OEM handle and has been holding up well so far. Recommended.
positive,"Bigger and sturdier than I thought but not too tall, I am glad because it fits my 2015 GTI hatchback perfectly and the cooler bag is great"
positive,This is a good size. A lot of these mirrors are typically overpriced. This was the cheapest one and it gets the job down.
negative,Easy to install but they absolutely do not stick.
positive,"Fit well, great price. Great alternative and cheaper than new seats for a Jeep who carries dogs and leaves the too off. Husband likes them a lot!"
negative,"Installed in my 2005 T&C (Driver's Side).  Came with the Passenger side arm installed, so I removed it and tried to install the supplied arm for the Driver's side.  It did not want to push on, so I had to squeeze it on with some channel locks before I could install the set screw.  It's a ""keyed' assembly and I could feel it drop into the slot, but it would not push on. No biggie here, once the arm is installed it's fine.<br /><br />I then tried to install the rod into the locking arm/lever and the rod wouldn't push through, so I removed the arm/lever and pushed the rod in and then pushed it into the arm.  It didn't snap in real well, so I'm concerned it might fall out sometime.<br /><br />When I tried to plug in the power plug and it would not ""click"" and snap in like it should.  I tried several times and pushed really hard, but it would not snap/lock.  I ended up putting a small piece of electrical tape on the mating surface so it's more of a press fit.  We'll have to see how long this one lasts??<br /><br />I've probably installed 7 of these over the life of the van and never had this much trouble before."
positive,"Works great, installs easily."
negative,"It pushes so little air that it actually *deflates* car tires rather than inflating them when you turn it on. Works fine on bikes, though."
positive,great value for the money
positive,exact fit on my 2006 Lincoln Mark Lt.
positive,It’s the second type of cellphone holder. It’s all made of silicone so it’s soft enough to not break down as the bike running across bumps and rough roads. So far so good.
positive,"Gift for son, he wears it all the time. Good quality."
positive,Perfect fit for 2013 Ram 2500
positive,Use this for my weekly car washes. Covers large surface areas. Just slightly heavy when it's wet and saturated with the soap
positive,"Right product, excellent finish"
negative,Straps kept breaking. Doesn't look as good as the photos. Can't get it as tight of a fit as I would like it. Regret not biting the bullet and just going with upholstery
positive,Purchased as a Christmas present- my friend absolutely loved it! Can't comment on it's use or durability but it seemed nice out of the box!
negative,Not happy! Driving different trips for 3 days and does not activate...
positive,"Perfect fit, great price."
positive,work good so far
positive,I have a leather couch and animals. I started getting scratch marks. This product was easy to use and really worked.
positive,"These lights are great! It took me 5 minutes to install these on my 2021 Subaru Crosstrek. Immediately, I noticed the increased brightness against my garage door. When I drove it that evening, I was amazed on how much brighter and clearer the illuminated area compared to the stock lights previously on.<br /><br />Also, the flood light coverage seemed wider to me. A 2 pack for this price is a great deal! Highly recommended!!"
positive,Good quality
negative,"When I bought this and first used it, I was amazed at how fast it charged.  It said 30 min, but it took about 45 min to charge.  I bought this on Jul 17.  Because of continuous rain, I have not been able to use my trimmer that often.  On Aug 18, I was able to get out and use my trimmer.  After the first battery discharged, I put it on the fast charger.  The light would blink continuous red.  I took it out, and did everything I could think of, and it still wouldn't work.  I tried 3 batteries with the same result.  As my 30 day return was up with Amazon, I wrote Black and Decker.  I have yet to hear from them.  I guess I am stuck.  I was hoping to get a replacement, but don't guess that will happen.  But, will not buy another."
positive,Good oil
positive,super bright
positive,"I have an all white car and pink isn't really my thing, but I said whatever and decided to girly my car up a little bit. The slogan is GREAT! Love how it looks when it's passing by. Great buy!"
negative,Not comfortable to wear too small
positive,The product doesn’t come with instructions. It was easy to figure out where the pieces fit. Utube confirmed the the position. Works perfectly in the trunk of suv.
positive,We have a 2012 Hideout and our original door cam when bad. This was very easy to replace and it works perfectly.
positive,"It's really easy to use. I have a couple of gallon sized jugs left over from other things, so I just dump the measured portion into them and fill with tap water, so I always have 2 gallons of wiper fluid ready to refill my car.  Or, if you don't have extra jugs, you can just measure and pour the same amount into your car container after you run out, and then fill it up with water from the tap or from a hose.<br /><br />It's far easier than having to buy them at a store, transport to my house and unload from the car. And buying at a store costs about 4 to 6 times more than this approach. You also prevent a ton of environmental waste. About 90% of the plastic that's put in a recycling bin these days ends up in a landfill because there aren't enough uses for them. So the gallon jugs of wiper fluid you regularly buy are going into a landfill, where they'll never decompose.<br /><br />This avoids that, plus saves you a ton of money and also saves you time and effort versus the store method."
positive,Worked out just fine. Everything fit just rite.
negative,"The indicator showed tire pressure very, very wrong; I would say the reading was showing the air compressor pressure instead of the tire pressure.. I was able to verify the error in the readings with a reliable electronic meter that I have used for years, I was very disappointed with this purchase and for this I returned it."
positive,"Installed them on my Jeep Cherokee. They work great, even in South Florida rainstorms."
positive,Pretty straight forward install bit tricky on the passenger side preferred to install it with out the metal bar to the bumper
positive,I searched everywhere and couldn't find one to fit a very small trailer.<br />This worked perfect
positive,"car oil filter fits perfect, & does its job for 10,000 miles which is when I change oil & filter using synthetic oil."
positive,Great product & it was delivered rapidly.
positive,"Quick delivery, no surprises."
positive,Looks like they came from the GMC factory. Great fit
positive,"I have two of these, to check my RV’s level, one on the fridge and the other near the driver seat—saves getting up unnecessarily while leveling. My only complaint is that they eventually leak so that they’re no longer usable. But they’re good for several years and cheap to replace."
positive,Great light...great price
negative,Took several applications to see any improvement. I read the reviews before purchasing. The Positive reviews never stated how often they had to apply to get the film off of the light cover
positive,Simple to program! Don't hesitate to purchase
positive,"Yes, this plastic restorer works. I followed the instructions as written and didn't have any issues applying the product.<br /><br />I restored the OEM step rails on my 2017 Ram 1500. My truck is parked outside. The sun is not kind to any plastics. I know better than to use any plastic restorer on the exterior. Over the years (40+) I found nothing that worked for more than 2 weeks or maybe 2 car washes.<br /><br />After watching Project Farm (on YT) I decided to give this restorer a go. Mind you I had NO faith in this product based on my previous experiences.<br /><br />Applying was easy but I had issues getting the product in the treads of the steps. Cotton applicators didn't work as they smushed down and couldn't reach the corners. My only solution was to multi-fold the little towelette and work my way through the treads. On mam was this a pain in my buttocks. Very slow but working.<br /><br />My wife saw me struggling with the treads and said ""Hold on, I got an idea"". She came back with a dotter. This arts craftsy tool makes perfect paint dots. But when wrapped around my towelette I was able to whiz through the treads. I love my wife more every day!<br /><br />200 car washes? Let's be real here. Even if I washed my truck once a week, which I don't, that would take 3.85 years.<br /><br />I will add images of my side steps every 3 months. Let's see if Cerakote really works or is another snake oil."
positive,"I love this little bling  . . .  however, it does not want to stay sticked to my ignition - especially in the summer when it's so hot.  I go to the car, and invariably,  it's on the floor - half way under the driver's seat!  I might try some Elmer's glue..."
positive,thanks
positive,Everyone that pulls a trailer should have this in the tool pack. Can readily see if the truck is the issue with lights and brakes
positive,"Best Windshield wipers I ever owned. Sturdy, cleans window, doesn't skip spots. Had another brand that was pretty flimsy. These are a major improvement on that."
positive,"So I wedged this facing away from the seat, and it fits between my seat and the emergency brake handle. It's also exactly where I was dropping things. Works for me, not necessarily for everyone. Handy to put things into temporarily also. Good product.<br /><br />If I wanted to have it overlap my seat a bit, having the extra padding it comes with would be super helpful. I needed something very narrow, and a very particular alignment, which this is. You may be looking for something more robust - if so, this is just basic sleek plastic on the interior, and I would pick something with some grip or sections so things don't slide around."
positive,I love this stuff. I have boots and purses that were really drying out. This makes them look new again. I will NEVER be without it.
negative,Could be a bit longer handle
positive,Very nice fit perfectly on my sti 15 thanks
positive,It's Honda OEM replacement parts.  The best.
positive,Installed nicely in my 02 330xi. It's been about a month and it's still working! Couldn't beat the price!
positive,"Driving Uber and Lyft for the last three years, I've had well over 3000 rides. The car wash I used to keep my car sparkling clean also had these air fresheners. Everybody always commented how pleasant my car smelled. Many asking where they can get these. Well that car wash got cheap and stopped carrying them. Thank goodness I've found them on Amazon. Yes, I'll admit the scent doesn't last very long, but for less than 25 cents each. Well worth it."
positive,The gloves fit perfectly and we’re more comfortable than anticipated.
positive,So as for the seat cover I like it. They have like a little bit of extra cushion which makes the seat cover more comfortable. The installation of it The front seats are pretty good It's a little tricky with electric seats. am I Subaru of the seat on the driver side is electric and it's a bit of a pain to get the straps to reach around and connect It's a little finagling. The passenger seat is just manual that had no problems whatsoever connecting to it. The back seats with the headrest covers its sharp It's a little weird with the center pad getting it together and getting it right. But I still think it's a good quality and no one ever sits in the back I have a dog cradle that the dog sit on anyways so that covers the back seat but if you have cloth seats like I do it makes it has gives it that rich leather feel. As would I recommend it I probably would just know it's a little tricky with that electric seat.
positive,"When replacing the propane tanks on our travel trailer, we wanted to replace the stand and regulator so they are new also. These are just like the regulator that originally came with our trailer. They work great. Happy to find these on Amazon. Great purchase!"
positive,good product.<br /><br />it helps to keep my car seats shine and look like new.<br /><br />Great.
positive,I use PureOne filters when ever i can find them in stock. I have read very good reviews of them and am pleased with their performance myself.
positive,We installed this about a year ago in our Toyota Matrix and it is still working great!
positive,Just concerned if heat will not let Velcro hold it<br />Time will tell
positive,Needed something to cover up these heavily stained seats on the car I just got. I normally would've waited and got a set of covers from costco on sale but really didnt want one of those wetsuit style covers as they get really hot on long commutes. So I opted for these cause the quilt style pattern. They fit good so far but as others said they have a super thin see thru sides where they wrap around. So over time they'll stretch out easily and in the drier hot regions they'll fall apart fast but they ain't no custom $400 covers so i'm happy
positive,"This is a terrific sunshade, however it did not fit my car  - my fault not looking at the measurements.  The shade is well made and will work great. It will have to go back."
positive,Worked great and easy to put on
positive,read the headline
positive,Battery came fully charged and on time.
positive,Easy to install and easy to read .... except in the bright sunlight. Really like these gauges.
positive,"They work, serve their purpose.  However in the picture it looks like they are more of a dark grey with darker black letters IMO.  They are entirely black and reading the tacoma isn't as clear as the pic.  They still look good and do the job but just wish they were easier to read."
negative,Would not plug in.  Nothing else to say.
positive,I had to heavily modify for a 98 isuzu hombre (chevy s-10) install.  Good product.
positive,Works great and looks great on my 2005 mustang. It works just as good as the tall original antenna. It's a cleaner look.
negative,"Absolutely does not fit a 2012 Chevy Tahoe despite what the guide says. They do not take returns, so I had to dispose of a brand new, very expensive battery. Never. Again. Avoid Optima at all costs."
positive,Cute and functional
positive,I have this for 2 months. It works pretty well for its cheap price. no complaint so far.
negative,Pretty average battery.  But affordable.
positive,The area that the ECT Sensor is in has a good possibility of extreme heat - sensor connector and wires can get brittle. Not to hard to fix but must be prepared to splice into the harness.
positive,"Lo instale en mi camioneta muy facilmente, cumple con lo que ofrece, esta construido con productos de media alta calidad"
positive,"This light is exactly what I was looking for. It is completely waterproof and it's a bright light. Several of the flash patterns are virtually useless in my opinion, but there a few good patterns that get attention. My light has been through a few good storms and I've never had problem. This is the best magnetic light one will find without spending a lot more money. Finally, it has a guarantee! I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again."
positive,Ease of use and feels very sturdy.  We had to push an atv up the ramps and we're both 69 years old and wasn't hard at all.  Husband does weights 3 times a week but still I think the slope of the ramps were great.  Good buy for sure.
positive,Perfect replacement. Dealer told us to do these ourselves because it's cheaper and easy to do. These fit great and were easy to install.
negative,"These would be great fishing anchors.<br />Installed them, they produce zero spark. One of the damaged 46 year old coils they are replacing still sparks merrily along.<br /><br />I'm going to try replacing the plug caps with NGK ones I have, either way they have been nothing but trouble. I don't understand how everyone else seems to have positive reviews."
positive,"This is a good, affordable standard H7. Is as good as it can be.<br /><br />I rated brightness at 5 stars, even if you can buy brighter H7. The problem is they last 2 weeks, and this one is going to last for year or two. There is no magic trick with H7. Standard one with proper wattage will be no brighter than this one. To have brighter bulb you need to achieve higher temperature or higher wattage. One shorter life significantly, the second is not street legal and may be too much for your reflector."
positive,"Kiddo is going as a Bioshock Little Sister for Halloween this year, so we naturally needed this for the Adam injector. We're very excited to have come across this item."
positive,Works like they said and easy to install.
positive,Fit perfectly
negative,It's 2 shades too dark on my 2005 Mini Cooper S in Chili Red. Looked good at first but dries much darker.
positive,"Perfect fit. 2014 durango limited. Super easy to install. Less than 20 min. Drop the spare, undo 4 bolts and put it back together. Heavy-duty."
positive,"Way heavier duty then expected.  Looks like they will be very durable, non slip, easy to car vac, I mean perfect fit in my 2007 caliber.  Nice and on price point."
negative,"I have tested this charger on:<br /><br />1) Gel-cell that I know is bad. The charger read out says the bad battery is fully charged? Nothing about the battery will not even accept a charge. I do not expect this pulse charge to fix the battery, but it says it is repairing it. This charger is far from intelligent.<br /><br />2) Gel-cell I know for certain is good with only 8 volts. This charger works for about 45 seconds and states the battery is full. The fact is it is only charged to 8 volts when checking with fluke volt meter.<br /><br />3) Used on car battery during -3 degree night. I checked the car battery with fluke volt meter before attaching this charger, read 12.5 volts.  Next morning when I check, this charger says battery is full. Fact is when checking it fluke volt meter it was down to 10 volts.<br /><br />Simply put, I have a bad battery charger or this is junk."
positive,"Worked perfectly on my 2017 Indian Scout.<br />I highly recommend this for anyone with a bike, fits perfectly in the saddle bags."
positive,"I really wanted this to work for my jeep, but it simply didn’t fit. Instructions said that it would be a tight fit, but it just didn’t work for me. As far as the product, it seemed to be of great quality, and I really wished it had worked for me. The leather was very soft."
positive,"I've used this 3M Spray Lubricant mainly on the garage door for our condo compex and on hinges of indoor doors.  It's very easy to use.  The small extension tube helped me pinpoint the area that I wanted to lubricate with no mess at all.  My brother used it on his bike and prefers it to WD40.<br /><br />I hadn't noticed a strong smell, but it's important to wash your hands and clothes immediately after using the spray lubricant for health reasons."
negative,Update...i ordered a 2nd batch the those came in as a totally different item. more link a normal ring with a dark grey chrome. disappointed...<br /><br />first batch- Super useful rings. Just the right size to add to zipper pulls to make it easy to get my finger in there to open the zipper.
positive,Great replacement for factory pads.  Easy to install and works great.  Polaris is quiet again when using the brakes!
positive,A+
positive,I like them for transporting the containers.
positive,Just what was needed to protect my new hitch from crud and rust.
positive,asdescribed
positive,"Fast shipping, great price, No brainer to install. Perfect fit."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:378bfd5c95795d4779e7950ce14fca34]] I've tried several windshield sunblock products. The circle ones, the roll out/in ones and the thin accordion ones. I concluded that the accordion sun blocking shields are the best for what I'm looking for. This product is the best for the price. Yes, its not the cheapest but certainly not the most expensive one. But it works great! I have a 2018 Cadillac XT5 and I live in Florida. Need I say more? Highly recommended."
positive,"I installed this on my 2018 Nissan Frontier SV. I wanted to allow the engine to breathe a little better and hopefully gain a little power for towing and maybe a little better fuel mileage. So far I can honestly say my truck does feel like it has a little more grunt when the RPMS are up around 3500 to 4500. My truck doesn't down shift as much when I'm towing my camper or boat in hilly areas. I have noticed that on the highway using cruise control, I'm getting roughly 1 mpg better fuel mileage. I have not noticed any mpg gain around town but that doesn't surprise me. I will say that this intake does sound bad a** around 4000 RPM's when I floor the throttle. I know that if I add a better exhaust that I would see better overall results from this intake."
negative,Eh just ok.  Cant beat newspaper an windex
positive,It reflects my feelings perfectly!
negative,"As a test, I used Leather CPR on one side of my purse only.  I can't tell the difference from one side to the other.  I followed the instructions exactly.  I even purchased a new sponge.  The purse is cognac/luggage colored.<br /><br />No difference = why buy?<br /><br />What a waste of money."
positive,works well as it should
positive,"Screws int easilly o install, audio quality is great. I am not getting all the digital data of the radio call sign anymore, so my player tells me that instead of listening to ""KDUK"" I am listening to ""J!UL"" - whicch is a little odd, but can be humorous at times!"
positive,"It's Rancho, all great products!"
positive,"I got this a year and a half ago because my car was nearing 290,000 miles and I thought I might as well get this kit while my mechanic was in replacing the front gaskets. It seems to be doing fine, no complaints so far. One strange thing did happen though...my belt jumped a few notches! I can't say why it happened...both my mechanic and I are confused. He put things right and no problems since. Lucky me, I have a non-interference engine. My mechanic did mention that the belt looked like it was in perfect shape, so it wasn't a mechanical failure, probably just a freak accident. Considering my car is just an oddity, I don't place the blame on this product and retain 5 stars for the rating."
positive,I use this product on all our bridles and saddles ! Works great ! Came on time and was a good price !
positive,"The visor sticker/vinyl is great!  It's a simpler way to cover it up with something (tint, graphic or otherwise) without the hassle of heat and stretch products.<br /><br />I would like to suggest to the developer though, that the stickers be reversed, so they can be adhered from the inside of the helmet.  Reason being, while you can see through the sticker (perfectly fine when it's dry), when it rains the perforations fill with water, making it impossible.  If the sticker were on the inside of the visor, then that would not be an issue... making visibility MUCH better in wet weather.<br /><br />I'm going to buy a black one and hope that it's black on the stick side also and test that expectation."
negative,"I purchased this for a 2002 Mazda B2300 with 2.3L engine. This is the same as the 2001 - 2003 Ford Ranger with 2.3L engine. Item was 1/32"" too thick and would not fit. Tried sanding down the end to the correct size, but still could not get it in there properly. Hard to find the OEM part so I went with aftermarket and it didn't end well."
positive,Bright light
positive,"Easy to install. Great light quality, quantity, and color. Very easy to use in a existing fixture with no rewiring or bypass of the transformer."
positive,"This stuff has made all the difference in our cars. I am not a professional detailer, but am OCD about things being clean and looking nice/new. This brought life back to the plastics in our cars and repels dust for WEEKS. Best part, you dont need a lot of product. A little goes a long way. I will repurchase whenever I might run out."
positive,"I pulled my 30,000 LBS schoolbus out of a pretty good rut with these guys as the anchor... that's all the proof I need."
positive,Perfect fit for Velar 2020
positive,Put on 2011 Dodge Durango-5.7L Hemi. Worked great.
positive,Great product at a great price.
negative,"I wore this on a 10 hour motorcycle ride from Austin to New Orleans, where it was raining for about 8 of those hours. Probably one of the more miserable rides of my life that was not made any better by a failing rain suit. Most of the waterproofing material had rubbed off leaving the jacket looking like Swiss cheese. I had read reviews from multiple places saying this was a good one, but it did not stand up to the ride and I returned it as soon as I got back. Still on the hunt for a solid rain suit that will actually keep me dry"
negative,A pain in the rear to adhere.
positive,Noticeable and improved night light for my Prius. The regular headlamps from the Prius are very bad but after replace them with the Phillips ultra I'm getting better night time driving.  I'm just concern about how long it will last.
negative,"Seller very easy to work with and provided full refund.  This is whey I am rating a ""3"" and not a ""1."" The issue was the spring was too weak to hold the bar in place.  When I extended the pull-out cargo cover and got it to where the tabs would be inserted into the slots, the unit popped out most of the time.  When it didn't pop out is when I discovered the tabs were too wide to fit into the slots at the back of the Telluride.  The seller apologized and provided a complete refund."
positive,"I live on a lake with shoreline on the back side of the property.  With summer heat the water has receded quite a bit so I now have some lake bed foliage to mow, which has resulted in me getting my John Deere zero turn mower stuck in the muck twice in the last 3 weeks.  Last time I got my 4wd truck stuck trying to free the mower and had to call on a neighbor to come help.  He had one of these straps and pulled both my F250 and my mower (connected to my truck) out of the mud.  So I immediately logged on to Amazon and ordered one.  The add'l length of this strap will also help allow me to stay on dry ground if I get the mower stuck again.  This strap is heavy duty, great quality, and way more than I need but one never knows when a heavy pull might be in order so better to have and not need than otherwise."
negative,Cheap product
positive,"I love that it’s squishy and not hard like my factory console armrest. I put it in an 01 grand Cherokee. It’s a little smaller than factory but works pretty well. I don’t like how tall it is, I’m kinda short and with it being taller, it makes my shoulder hurt if I have my arm propped up too long. Also, one of the pockets on the side-the seam ripped apart after a week. Only reason I kept it was because it’s so much more comfortable on my elbow than factory."
positive,"Happy I ordered these! Work great, good price. What more can you ask for!"
positive,Very nice
positive,Keeping my auto clean and safe from carpet tears and stains. Well worth the cost.
positive,Simple set up and lays out nicely. The best part is my Yeti 20 oz insulated coffee mug fit on the sides pockets. I was also able to get a square Kleenex box in the big pocket on top. Hold pump hand sanitizer and masks for easy access and use.
positive,I like them. They look very good. Seems like decent quality..Just put them on a week ago..Lets see how stand up to the Florida sun and salt air.
negative,"this is good, your car will look nice and sporty, BUT if you leave in a very hot area, even if you have the best 3m double sided tape, it will eventually fall off in very hot weather. save your time and money , you will finally decide to throw it away and clean the sticky tape from your car, which I am doing now for the last days. have mercy on your mustang, leave it alone. it looks awesome without it anyway."
positive,The o ring is loose in the box. Be sure not to lose it like I almost did opening it outside by the grass.
positive,It's a Gas cap. What else can I say
positive,Worked perfectly.  Thank you!
positive,Great product light when welding. Highly recommend!
positive,This shade fits perfectly.  I like that it is a folded rigid shade.  It keeps it shape and holds well in the front window.  It certainly keeps the inside a little cooler on hot days.
negative,"Bought these pads to pair w the Amazon Basic Stands but they’re ill fitting & don’t seem very secure. Nothing wrong w the quality, just didn’t seem to be a good fit."
negative,Carefully followed directions.  Didn't do anything.  The scratch in the car finish doesn't appear to be that deep but this just wasn't helpful.
negative,"highly flammable per the instructions, smells for days, and DO NOT GET ON PAINT, as it is a bear to remove without damage to the paint.<br />looks ok when<br /> applied to exterior black trim, but clearly not worth the danger again oer their instructions<br />BUYER BEWARE"
positive,"Works just as they say it will and the customer service is wonderful.  They really care about their product and your satisfaction, so it's worth the buy in many reguards."
positive,Great quality car cover and it fits the 1964 Studebaker well.  Works well to keep dust and rain off the car.
positive,Quality made and quick shipping.
positive,"This sun visor works perfect on my car, the lights function and it installed great, but the clips that came with it are crap, use the original clips if you can!"
positive,Second one we bought. It really does move air around inside RV fridge. Our other one stayed with last trailer !  Little extra for new owner !  It's a great product runs forever !
positive,Easy to install
positive,Easy fit. Good torque.
positive,Love the way it looks
positive,"no clip to hold in place  a jury rigged one had to be built, Shift handle of good quality"
positive,"I bought these several weeks ago.  Filled tires to desired PSI. Have checked tires,  and these appear to be accurate. It's a less expensive method to keep an eye on PSI on my fifthwheel.  I will update in a few months. The pruduct was well packaged, was on time, and appear to be well made!"
negative,I’m a mailman and I need socks to keep my feet warm in the winter! I’ve worn them twice. Once at work and once at a football game! Once the temps got into the 30’s my feet started to get cold!  They should say not under 40 degrees let alone -40!  Waste of money’
positive,Excellent
positive,Easy to install. Looks great.
positive,This prodcut is easy to fit and worked perfectly to STOP the annoying belt squeal due to the old tensioner allowing the belt to become misaligned with other pulleys.  My truck sounds great now!
positive,"We go to the beach, dance and get sweaty, and do all sorts of stuff, so this is a great way to prevent seats from getting nasty and the car getting stinky from the sweat and moisture! Pretty easy to put on, you can also use this to sit on when you're outside, though with the plastic handle attachments, it can be pretty darn uncomfortable if your booty lands on one of those. Whether you have kids, dogs, or active people doing messy things, this is a great way to keep your car clean. As someone noted, there are better seat covers for dogs, since you usually want more of a cradle/U-shaped design, and it's not exactly easy with this setup, but if you're not looking for that particular configuration, this is great and gets the job done!"
positive,Wix is one of the better brands and this looks just like the factory one that it replaced. Much cheaper too. I'll be ordering another when it's time to replace again.
negative,Don’t waste your money. Installed a pair and one of them started flickering within six months.
positive,We get lots of laughs from people when this is place on our tow vehicle in campgrounds.
positive,This was a perfect fit on my 08 Dodge Ram 1500. This is the switch that goes on the dashboard below the vent knobs and above the cup holders. It was super easy to put in and it works great!
positive,"If you have kids and have had these sticky handles then you probably know about people getting some of that paste on their clothes or person. It’s the most embarrassing and frustrating thing when you have to constantly make people aware “watch the door handle”, “watch your clothes”. Now I don’t have to worry about it! Several helpful YouTube videos and 20-30 min a side and we were able to replace them all. Way cheaper than going to a reupholstery shop or the dealership! Save yourself that money and use it towards other things, like new AC Schnitzer parts :)"
positive,"Put this in our car, and seems to do the job just fine! Great price as well!"
positive,Mechanic put them in but they've been great.
positive,"These last fairly a long time here in Florida under extreme UV and heat conditions.  I researched reviews and customer feedback and this brand comes out as the best.  You pay more but you get what you pay for.  In Florida, its important to have good and reliable auto products and this is one of them for your maintenance plan.  I had to wait to write this review in order to test them myself.  4 stars because there is always room to improve performance and quality."
positive,The best filter I have every owned. My car runs better when I changed from the filter they gave me at the oil change place with this one. Buy this filter.
positive,"One year update:<br /><br />These have seen the entire spectrum in regards to weather and they look the same now as they did when new (with upkeep and cleaning of course). Fit and finish is still excellent.  Very happy with these floor liners. Highly recommend!<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />I bought these floor liners for the front and back of a CPO 2019 Honda CR-V LX AWD we recently purchased. The vehicle only came with cloth/carpeted floor mats and with winter here I knew we needed something more substantial. I did research, looked at different brands and these were one of the least expensive yet they have very good reviews. Thankfully, the description is accurate and its quality is very good. I would definitely recommend these if you are looking for solid, inexpensive, and functional floor liners for your vehicle."
negative,"Installed these with matching Wagner coated rotors on a 2011 Santa Fe 3.5L.  Everything is easy to install, but the Wagner clips included with the pads rub the outer edge of the Wagner rotor.  There was a horrible scraping noise on the test drive.  This is why I gave a 3 star rating.  The original Hyundai pads provide much more clearance from the rotor, so I cleaned them up and reused them.<br /><br />Will update this review after a few months of driving."
positive,"This fits perfect in the back floor of my husband truck and does not tip over, great item."
positive,"I bought this to replace the outdoor shower head on my Class B motorhome, which lacked pressure. This is only slightly better in that regard, but it is much more convenient to use, and because it’s smaller, it’s easier to store. The thumb lever is easy to use, and it locks and unlocks intuitively."
positive,Nice and easy installation.
positive,Fit nut and worked well. nSet for some oil changging.
negative,It works...kinda. Its a pain to use the suction cups every time. It doesn't hold it's up. Impossible to fold.
positive,These tracks are awesome. I've owned 3 different sets all from different brands. This set seems to be grippier than other sets I've used. The plastic doesn't seem quite as rigid as other sets.<br />These are great for getting out of a muddy situation.
negative,The applier sponge fell apart after 2 square feet of surface coverage. It left a very blotchy finish despite buffing with a towel shortly after application. Bought it to restore the finish of a solid 2 yr old F-150 pick-up bed cover. About 24sqft. It did a little less tha 8 sq ft. Good thing I had some Meguir’s to finish the job & cover the garbage finish left by this product. Waste of money.
positive,Was with instructions on container
positive,Great product. Used on recent flight on a 757.
positive,"This stuff really works! Noisy pots and switches on 30+ year old stereos, and electric-guitars, amps and the like. Amazing!"
positive,I used this to replace a cracked tail light on my 2013 Mazda CX-9. It went on the same as the old one and you can't even tell it's a replacement.
positive,"I am now a believer in Flitz.  I am using it on small glass jewelry pieces, but the applications are limitless.  I highly recommend this product for anyone crafting jewelry or doing any work with polymer clay or resin.  This stuff is great.  The tube I purchased will likely last me at least 5  years, as a little bit goes a long way."
negative,"I have a Honda Accord 2005 EX Sedan. They don't tell you this, but the way the plug is designed, you have to CUT OFF one of the little latch clips because there is one on both sides. The socket in my car only has space for one of these little latches, which is how it clicks in. So you have to somehow make sure it's the right polarity before you literally have to cut off one of the latches (with what!?) and you can't turn the lights on to make sure because it won't go in, not to mention the battery has to be removed for the driver side installation. I would not have bought these if that was clear ahead of time, but you will see in their pictures that the little latch is not even there in the picture!<br /><br />There is no number to call, so now I am waiting to see what they say after I sent a message. I will update the review accordingly."
positive,this is a wonderful decal.  I was so impressed when i opened my package.  It is unmistakably Ariel!  Very detailed and nicely made.  Very happy
negative,"Bought this to siphon gas out of snowblowers.<br />Hoses won't stay on.<br />Hoses become stiff in winter use.<br />Pump freezes, have to take apart and lube to move it.<br />Don't know why this model is rated so high. Just cheap, hard, plastic junk!<br />Would not recommend!"
positive,It was very cute and good quality
positive,"Tape is quite thin, but it's the 3m stuff so darned if it doesn't stick (if you heat it and your tank up a bit before sticking). Make sure you hold pressure for a while, and use a hair dryer to heat the tank and the tape."
positive,it works like new
positive,Works
positive,Bought to use with my Porter Cable Orbital 6&#34; machine. Works great to apply both Wax and newer (to me) polymer sealant products.
positive,Great price!
positive,GOOD QUALITY AND DOES NOT FALL OFF EVEN AFTER WASHING YOUR CAR
positive,Does not work
positive,I love this product! I does rain AND snow easily.
positive,As advertised.
positive,"This was a great addition to my vehicle and so much cheaper and less hassle than buying actual wheels.  I don't love the shape of the former generation's plain-Jane CR-V LX's wheels, but slather them in chrome and they look a LOT better over the almost matte-silver painted wheels.  I was parked next to another LX without these and was impressed at how much difference they make.  They ARE a little tough to put on, but that's actually good because it gives me confidence they'll stay on and not to whizzing off if I hit a bit pothole.  Love 'em!  Bought a set for my wife's 2014 CR-V (different shape and not available at this time on Amazon) and they are amazing too"
positive,"I've purchased brake rotors from Amazon, though not these. I did purchase the same exact model for my 2011 Ford Explorer from RockAuto, 5-1/2 years ago. They are just now in need of replacement. Amazing! They stop good too. :) Love 'em."
negative,Clips are weak and have little holding strength.
positive,Arrived with a few small scratches on the heat sink but nothing major.  It's very bright and the mounting hardware worked well for a front bumper mount.  Great product so far!  Will see how it holds up to moisture after being outside for awhile.
negative,"Doesn't fit my John Deere 112L, so I made an adapter.  Just slightly too firm and thick."
positive,"After comparing several name brand (Whelen, Federal) light bars, I picked this one and I'm glad I did!<br />Very bright, multiple patterns, excellent Plowing light!<br />I would highly recommend this!!"
negative,The app for this does not work and we cannot get this to work.
positive,perfect fit
positive,Work great! Thanks for  your quick service.
positive,"These worked great for my 2005 4Runner. Our other fob broke where it connects to the key ring. This was way cheaper than paying $153 at Toyota to order a new fob. Just pry off the back of your current fob, take out the chip and put the chip into the new fob. It works great."
positive,I liked it was easy to connect and use on the motorcycle
positive,"Great location to hold the electric gate pass. Solved the problem to easily access the entrance gate pass. Or other small items, such as keys for another vehicle or lock. Fit was good, quality is good, easily installed."
positive,"It does appear confusing to first installing this.  But after it is done, it makes sense.  You would think by now all major auto manufacturers would have this as a standard item.  I am very happy with this, it does make a huge difference.  Just buy it, it makes things a lot easier."
negative,"Ordered 2 sets of 6 pcs in total. 1st set of 6 worked fine while other six did not work at all. Tried to change them with working ones, and it turned out so that the 2nd set of 6 was really malfunction. Very disappointed. Try smth else"
positive,Sticky tranny on my Odyssey.<br />It fixed the problem. As good as OEM
positive,Great product and price! Fits as it should.
positive,Seal is of great quality better than the National's I pulled off. This is the seal on the back of the inner wheel bearing hub. This is NOT the seal behind the CV joint axle. Fit my 2001 Xterra perfectly. These are what you replace when repacking the wheel bearings on most Nissans.
positive,"I've been waiting a couple of years for LED headlights to mature and become available for my 2014 GMC Terrain.  The halogens that were last installed, were past-due for replacement. I saw the Sealight High and Low beam kit, read the reviews and pulled the trigger.  They arrived on schedule and I was ready to tackle the remarkably difficult installation that GMC built into the vehicle maintenance. Thanks to YouTube, I got a chance to see the task, as performed by some skilled and physically flexible people. The Sealight product really does fit this car well, and performs to my expectations.  The output of the lights is exactly what I had hoped for, neither too little or too much.  They don't blind oncoming drivers and the projector design of the car's headlight lenses puts every bit of the light where it belongs.  Now, I'll have to wait and see if the lifetime and quality of the output hangs in their for a few months. I'll be back around June of 2020 to update my experience with this product. So far, so good."
positive,Made my job much easier on O2 sensors. Good quality tools
positive,"These are very study , well made . There not going to break easily at all."
positive,Great quality
positive,Does what it is supposed to do. Hauls my crap around.
positive,Perfect for my 2003 f250 6.0 powerstroke diesel.
positive,Used in conjunction with Reese anti-sway device to stop trailer from wobbling back and forth on a windy day.
positive,"So far I love it. Seems to be a good mount for the money. I've only ridden with it on my motorcycle one time but it stayed put and my phone didn't move around. In fact, I didn't even think about my phone during the ride and I guess that's the point."
positive,"This gear puller represents the ideal way to remove stuck rotor or brake drums.<br /><br />Main issue, is the included bolts, are tool small, making them very easy to lose.. When using this tool, don't let the pointed tip of the piston come in physical contact with anything. If the pointy tip becomes blunt, puller is useless at over 1 tons of pressing force."
positive,"This is Bosch, quality forever. No more comments need."
positive,"Totally dig these tires. Still getting used to them but my comfort level with them is adapting rapidly, which means they're a good tire. Unless you're not an avid rider and don't care much about your rubber, only go with bi-compound tires (tri-compound if you track your bike).<br />The only competitors to this tire is the Diablo's and mayyyybe the Dunlop sportmax Q3 (but I wouldn't use anything other than Pirelli, nothing against other brands its just a preference). I have these Angel GT's on one of my R6's and Diablo's on my other one. Love 'em.<br />I wish Toyo made motorcycle sport tires... That would certainly give Pirelli a run for their money."
positive,definitely improved the ride of my honda pilot
positive,Fits perfect Pathfinder 2013 (Front Driver) Shipping Faster than expected 4 days
positive,It is a good product
positive,"Nice starter. Great power, made a world of difference in my truck."
positive,Great product! Holds battery securely.
positive,Bought as a gift. Recipient loved them
positive,"Excellent in every way.  Easier to remove and polish than the old pink stuff.  Ieillbe using and buying more!  Thanks, Amazon, for making this available."
positive,"This is exactly what my husband was looking for. He needed something to cover his face while he plays with his toys. He loves this mask and even the magic scarf too. He is a very large man and this fits him perfectly, as well as my head too. It doesn't smell bad and isn't terribly stiff. This is such a great find.<br />I tested this at no charge for a truthful review."
positive,Worked as advertised on a ZR2 S10.
negative,Don't fit my trailer spare. Built tuff tho.
positive,Great replacement - Perfect fit - Easy install.
positive,OEM quality.
positive,"It's the first thing I take out of the trailers storage box when I get to a site and the last thing to go in. Quick, simple to use and solid. Not good for mushy ground or soft gravel. You'd want to have the usual planks and blocks then. I've not had to do that yet though. Glad I got these."
negative,"The bristles were falling out like a cheap paint brush. I must have lost 30 bristles in 3 minutes. If it keeps up like this, I might get 5 uses out of it and that doesn’t even cover all the seats in my car."
positive,Quality as expected!
positive,Love the weight locks the wheels from moving. The product was delivered on time and put into used right away.
negative,Good
positive,"easy to use and work great, but they are really tall."
positive,Seems to work as expected. So far so good.
positive,"Picked it up for an upcoming road trip.  I like that it comes in the bag..I was worried I would have to keep  it in the box.  Haha.<br /><br />It's got a bright screen (especially nice if you have to use it at night).  You can set the PSI so the pump shuts down at the right time without having to keep an eye on things.  For that alone, it's worth buying.<br /><br />This thing is a total beast, too.  Metal and decent plastic.  It's a LOT heavier than the pump we keep in my wife's car, BUT it also pumps a LOT faster.  Comparative:  Hers - 24PSI to 35PSI is about 6 minutes.  Mine - 28PSI to 35PSI was about 3 minutes...after our trip, I'm probably going to put this one in her car.<br /><br />Can work off a battery or the car lighter.  That's handy to keep around the garage.  Also comes with an inflation needle for other equipment so this is a must for sports families.<br /><br />Absolutely love it and that you can set it to shut off at a certain PSI is awesome.  I just wish I would have had this last year when I found out my spare was flat when I went to change a tire."
negative,Had 3 duds out of the 8 had to go and pay 50 a piece at AutoZone cuz I needed my truck.  Buy at your own risk. Cheaper isint always better
positive,Very pleased with my purchase
positive,They work perfect. Great quality
positive,"2002 V6 accord was starting to shift very hard, added 2 syringes and took for a very long drive and after a few says shifted like brand new. I couldnt believe it worked that well.<br />I just bought a beautiful Acura will same same tranny, low miles and fully loaded but purchased extremely cheap due to it shifting hard , hoping it works its wonders on the Acura as it did the honda"
positive,Love this addition. Drop off and pick up line at school is no longer filled with only Jesus fish!
positive,These showed up quickly and they're the correct OEM filters for my Subaru.  No wondering if back pressure is set properly and all that jazz.  I've got a 2014 Forester and they work just dandy.
positive,Nice portable unit<br />Suction poser could be better but it’s does the job
positive,I have a L3901 and need to grease over ten spots and this makes it a little faster. I would buy again.
positive,Always gfood to use a fresh crush washer to avoid leaks.  These are perfect.  I believe they are made out of aluminum and do their job well.
positive,Looks good on my car
positive,This is a great duster.  Does the job quickly.  If your car is really dirty don't think this little guy is gonna make it look new but it does clean it up quite a bit and brings back some shine.
negative,the square hold looks like easily stripped.
positive,"This is a very nice spinner knob. Spins very nice with no crunch bearing feedback. The bearing used seems to be of high quality. The knob itself feels very nice and provides the perfect amount of grip, you never feel as if your hand will slid off the knob while turning. The overall weight, texture and appearance is of a high quality product. They provide short and long screws to ensure you have the correct size. I would verify the diameter of your steering wheel before buying. Im using the steering knob for an off road ATV which has a larger diameter steering wheel so in my case I needed even longer screws to make it fit. They also included a nice thick piece of rubber which fits between the steering wheel and the knob in order to provides grip to prevent the knob from moving or sliding on the steering wheel. Once you tighten it down it will not move so make sure you put it where you want it. I would definitely recommend this to someone who needs this product. I would buy again myself. Cheers!"
positive,"Only negative comment is it's more white than black. Since interior of my car is black, I expected cover color to be more black."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:cf34ffb70adb832f0dc5233dce2ccf9b]] Sometimes your extra super sized large iced coffee won’t fit in your cup holder I guess, and you need a bigger one - well this might help.  Or maybe you just need more cup holders for mid<br /><br />I like the design. Seems easy to use and like it’ll meet expectations to improve the cup holder experience in a vehicle<br /><br />Overall I think it’s nice"
positive,on a quality oil.
positive,compact
positive,Works perfectly
negative,"Bought two of them.  The snaps bend and fall off. Once the two parts of the snap come apart they're never going back together tight enough to not pry apart when unbuttoning them from a helmet.  Cheaply fabricated button snaps ruin this product as does the rattling of the shield against the helmet.  I've purchased little rubber feet to put inside the shield to rest against the helmet but it loses the some appeal with to little nubs sitting in your helmet, and it's a clear design flaw.  Make a little rubber trim or something and the problem would go away.<br /><br />In summary more quality hard metal snaps, and a little bumper on each side of the shield might bring the cost up $2-4 a helmet but it would be well worth it.  Not buying anymore of these shoddy shields."
negative,"First things first -- the mats are pretty well made and allow for many customizations. That being said, the listing advertised those as being compatible with my 2016 Mazda CX-9. They are not -- front mat, on the driver side, partially covers acceleration pedal, and foot rest on the lest, even with all the &#34;optional&#34; parts being cut away. Rear mat, while bulging a bit in the middle, and not covering much area under the front seats, fits reasonably well.<br /><br />To reiterate, the mats would receive a 4 or 5 star review -- *if* they fit as advertised. Not sure who's at fault here -- Amazon, the seller, or manufacturer, but someone messed up."
positive,Worked excellent to replace rear window gas struts on a Ford Excursion.  Very easy to install when you follow the directions on Youtube.
negative,Cheeply made and does not fit correctly at all
positive,Item worked great and installed in under an hour. The quality appears to be great. They are not rock hard plastic so the look like they will hold up well.
positive,This kit worked perfectly on a 2012 Sonic which was having the issue with the key coming out of the ignition. Install was fairy easy and took less than an hour - I went very slow so as to make sure I did it correctly.  There are also videos out there you can watch. The kit was genuine GM.  I know I saved hundreds doing this myself.
negative,To hard to put in.  I could not even get my local body guy to deal with them.  I retuned them.  They do look good however.  They will charge a restocking fee.  I think it was was a bit excessive.
positive,"Looks great , well made"
positive,Good value for money.
positive,"These aren't going to turn your backup lights into spotlights, but they are definitely brighter. They seem like a decent product and after nearly a year no problems. The lights are more focused on the ends and while they are bright, I cant help but wonder if a 360 light would be brighter overall in my vehicle 2003 Honda Odessey backup light housings. I'd say if your bulbs ends are pointing straight back they will work great."
positive,Fits easily in trunk and sturdy enough to carry into store and home while fully packed.<br />Worth the money !
positive,Dropped right in.  Big improvement.
positive,Does the job of keeping our trailer locked up!
positive,An excellent product and company to deal with. Would deal with them again and highly recommend them with out hesitation. The product worked great.
positive,Have it wired to the buss bar on the ranger UTV but anytime I flick another switch it turns on! Will have to put a resistor or something inline to prevent this.
negative,"This is one of the better ones I found, but the arm is not real tight so, as you ride over a bumpy road it's position can shift a bit.  It however is still better then using a handlebar mirror, IMHO, because they just bump around too much."
positive,Easy fix to do. After watching a you tube video on how to do it I had the part swapped out in about 5 minutes. Looks and works like the original.
positive,"Very easy to slip on, stays on. Looks and feels good. If the buttons are already gone on your key.<br />You will need to put something where they used to be. I used 2 little 1/4” square piece of cardboard.<br />And taped them to the original key. Then I slipped the new cover on. Works like new and looks great.<br />I only bought 1 to try it out ordering another for my other key. Great product and price 5 stars !"
positive,Fits perfectly and appears well made.
positive,Not sure how long it will last but easy install and it works. Used on 2001 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel. Shipping was reasonably fast.
positive,"I only bought the ""smart"" version because it qualified for a rebate but since there is no app to use with it, it might as well be a dumb unit. I know that it can supposedly be controlled with other apps, but I haven't really found a clear list of which apps work, most of the ones I have found appear to be for commercial use, not personal use, so I find that very frustrating. I hope they will create a proprietary app soon, otherwise, the smart features are useless.<br /><br />The unit itself is a great little unit, I really like it and I am glad that I picked it vs other options. It was easy to mount, the quality is obvious, and the cord is easy to use (my old unit that burned out was way too thick and impossible to maneuver). If you don't care about the smart features and don't need a specific unit for a rebate, I recommend the dumb one, but this one is a great option."
positive,Most people probably would not even notice they are there but they do look nice and make the car a bit more polished
positive,Primarily tuning Stihl power equipment
positive,Worked well.
positive,Ok. So the yellow hooks fall off a lot. But for price it works good. Pretty happy with it.
positive,I had to get my first bag and this is a cute one. I used it to disconnect on a mini vacation.
positive,This is a great inverter perfect for my project
positive,They do what they say they're gonna do nice look...
negative,"&#34;And with the jumbo size of 27.6 x 51.2 inches, the shade will cover even the biggest windshields to not only keep out the heat, but also keep people from looking inside the car.&#34; This is not true, this shade is a full nine inches short of covering my Dodge Ram pickup left to right. Wish I had measured before ordering rather than relying on the spec sheet."
positive,"Installed these on a New to me 250X.  Easy Install, Lightweight protection, and they look sweet.  I wear knee braces and added these to reduce the pressure from my knees on the Radiator Shrouds."
negative,The filter was bad. Most are good but i got a dud this time! Opened new one and it acted clogged. Waste of $100
positive,"Ordered this to replace one that got misplaced and or lost or ""borrowed"". Did what it needed to do."
negative,"This socket came in 1/4 inch drive.  This is for a diesel truck fuel filter, not a lawn mower. Needs to be 1/2 &#34;"
positive,"Installed in 2010 tundra with 60000 miles, definitely noticed the difference, especially when towing 6500 lb travel trailer; although it’s nit a new engine it’s quality maintenance"
positive,Super heavy duty reciever. All solid steel.
positive,"I used the Liqui Moly 2037 Pro-Line Engine Flush before flushing the old oil.<br /><br />This Saturn is an old car I got from a friend.  Before the oil change, if I drove it past 70 mph, I could notice the car started to feel heavy, the performance dropped.  After the Engine Flush and the Anti-Friction Oil Treatment, I could go 75-80 mph or beyond without even noticing any performance degradation (on freeway flat surface).  Great stuff.<br /><br />I don't notice any significant difference in the MPG.  So if you are thinking this could save on MPG, my experience doesn't say so."
positive,"Every year we have to purchase another TT spare tire cover. They always look great at first. Fit as it should and, as always, hope to get as long of use as possible."
positive,Just one of these guys when you purchase something unseen you gotta get it out of the box and try it. Ok...fit is perfect and totally satisfied.
negative,I bought this since we did not get one when we bought our car.  It did not work on the back of the car.  There was not place to stick on the holders like it suggested.  I should have checked the car first before buying I guess.
positive,Perfect to quality
positive,This is a very nice assortment of clips. I found ones to use on two different places on my 2022 Honda. I was having trouble finding ones that fit but this batch had them. The tool that it comes with is helpful for some things but not for others. I didn't mark it down for that because that was not my reason for buying the kit. You however might find that it is too small and opening for some of the bigger clips on your car.
negative,BUYER BEWARE!!!!!.....These are strobe lights and therefore flash when installed.
positive,Easy to install. Just unhook the battery so the air bag won't go ofc
positive,Pads are quiet and very smooth feeling when stopping - arent quite broken in yet but so far so good
positive,Works like a champ. It gets hot if your tire is flat to the rim while pumping it up again.
positive,"These are a great improvement from what was sold for my 2006 Forester.  Quite, solid, easy to remove if you only want to have them there seasonally...the mpg seemed unaffected with them on,(wish I could say that about the Yakima Front loaders)  With two steel bikes on two Front Loaders there is a slight flex in the center, but driving from DC to Bar Harbor Maine as high speeds it seemed not to be an issue at all."
positive,I got a pair at my local car parts shop and paid about $50 more than these (took them back). Easy to install and do the job!
positive,They aren't quite as bright as I thought they would be and they had a straight plug where the OEM had a 90 degree angle plug. But they still fit and they are very good otherwise.
positive,Not as loud as I expected. I'm not sure that a typical car driver several feet away with the windows up will hear this. Kind of pricey for the volume level. Easy to mount and easy to use.
positive,Worked perfectly for my RV water hookup.
negative,"I'm actually really happy with the GPS aspect of the unit.<br /><br />However, I spent the extra money to get the Life-Time traffic updates, and the bluetooth connectivity. And I've found that the bluetooth isn't all that great. It doesn't connect automatically with my phone. It doesn't show your recent calls that weren't made through the phone. Etc.<br /><br />The traffic updates almost never work. When they do, it can never find a better route.<br /><br />Finally, the interface isn't very good either.  It's kinda clumsy and it's difficult to navigate if you're not familiar.<br /><br />It all boils down to the fact that it's a good GPS, and a sub-par everything else. It really makes me wish I had just gotten the cheaper one with no bluetooth, and no traffic updates."
negative,"I am on my first trip with my new Tireminder and am very disappointed. Not easy to install took me about 3 hrs as the unit gave false readings. No different on our trip, every single leg of this trip an alarm has gone off errantly. Not a single tire has escaped a warning. After numerous times of pulling over to check I finally just did an auto rescan when ever this pops up now. When I return from our long trip I plan on writing the Mfg and seek a return for a refund. Don’t buy this expensive hot mess of a system."
negative,Good quality but does not fit 2007 Tundra.
positive,likes chrome finish
positive,My favorite car trash can!!!
negative,It did not fit my car that well 😐
positive,VERY GOOD
positive,"Nice design the way this goes together, no issues whatsoever on my 78 Bette."
positive,Don't forget to take the metal alignment plate off the backside of the old inner pad to put into the new pad. These are great pads.
positive,"Custom tailored fit. Sharp looking. Slips on easily, then naturally compresses around key fob to fit securely.  Durable.  Protective.  Easy to remove fob from case when necessary."
negative,"Does not work as well as the video they show,  first it does slide all over the ground when trying to use it... and its basically big and cumbersome to use."
positive,Amazing. Both my gas tops were broken. Love the flexible spout.
positive,I was skeptical but the frames have held up great. They match my cars decals and the color and quality are the same after several months
positive,This plug is the shortest to use from 30amp rv to regular cord. Product is durable and very happy with it
positive,"Most RV screen doors are a little clumsy to open - this makes it much easier. Installation was a little more tricky than a similar product I bought a few years ago for an older camper because you need to do a little fitting and drilling of the handle itself, but I view that as a good thing because it means you can get a perfect fit. Seems like a very well made product to me."
positive,works
positive,The tannery is probably the best leather product I have ever used. I do wish they still made it in a hand spray as sometimes the aerosols just quit working.
positive,"Problem is, it gets dirty easy and is a bit slippery in hands...I wish this were made out of the rubber type material, then it would be perfect! I work a dirty job, so it is already really dirty and no longer looks nice which is such a bummer. I don't think washing it will get it clean either, so this won't last long for me. If you can keep your hands clean every time you get in your car this might be okay for you."
positive,Exactly what I needed.
positive,"I purchased this polish for my military child to use on brass.  Nothing works better, not even the famous brass liquid."
positive,"Been using the product for years on my Porsche Cayman S,, Subaru's (2), VW, and other models of cars I have owned.  Really cleans the old wax off my vehicles!!"
negative,This is a horrible product!!! Do not buy! Amazon also charges a restocking fee of like 20% for returning a product that is poor quality. This has no suction power!!!! Do not buy!!!! It’s not fair to Amazon Customers as we cannot see the item and how it works prior to buying it. Do Not buy from Amazon!!! Poor quality - horrible customer service!
positive,"I love these types of windshield shades, except for the PITA they are to put in and take out.  I can't seem but to hit my mirrors, hit my passenger, etc.  It works, but I wish I didn't need it."
negative,I tried calling the place no one answers There's a recording telling you that there's not open certain hours like Hola when it's supposed to be opened no one answers Trying to get Help was impossible
positive,Works
positive,Worked well. Color was darker than what is pictured so looked a little off in the car. If I could go back I would have spent more time matching the color to the pictures. What I thought was the right color was way off.
positive,"As of this review this door organizer costs around $30.00.  I would not want to pay any more than that for it.  I have had it on the back of my pantry door for a couple of days now and have found it helpful but also somewhat cumbersome.  It doesn't come with instructions so I had to refer to the picture on the product page when assembling it.  If you have any shelving next to your door on it's inside swing, then this organizer will hit and the door will not fully open.  We now have to almost turn sideways to get inside our pantry.  The red basket-like plastic shelves are convenient for holding things but I suggest nothing heavy since it's only plastic on two thin, flat metal hooks holding the rack on the door.  I can see too much weight fracturing the plastic and it all coming down.  I have loaded every shelf up with large (but light weight) plastic spice bottles and their removal off the regular shelves has opened up some more space in our over-crowded pantry.  I like this organizer well enough, but it might be better on the back of a bedroom door full of socks, underwear and stuff like that."
positive,"I sprayed one spray in the car, and it emitted a fresh lemon-lime natural scent.  I shut the door, did an errand in the house, and returned and you could still smell the scent.  It was not overpowering.  It smells fairly natural and fresh.<br /><br />I drove to a friend's house, was there a couple of hours, and got back into the car and the scent wasn't strong.  I didn't really notice it, but I didn't notice stale car odor either.  So, for a spot freshener, this seems like it works.  It isn't overpowering, the scent is fresh, and it immediately clears the interior of odors.  And it doesn't have a heavy scent that sticks around for hours.<br /><br />So, for getting rid of bad or stale odors quickly for a trip, it does the job.  Will report back as I use it more."
positive,Works for me. A little flimsy to put together. Rods do fall out easily so be careful when picking up to move into place.
positive,"Showed up in a couple days, just mounted on our 1989 Chevy Silverado...perfect, no problems so far!<br /><br />IMG_9111.JPG"
negative,"Advertised as a CHMSL (Center High Mount Stop Light) for a Cadillac Escalade.  NOT!<br /><br />And not by any stretch of the imagination, either."
positive,"Trailer chains. Thick, seem strong."
positive,"Great Scantool that is also fully compatible with FORSCAN. Previously owned an OBDLink SX that did not have all of the necessary protocol compatibility, and due to the great experiences I had with that unit, sought to purchase an updated replacement from the same manufacturer. Would highly suggest this product and would not hesitate to purchase again in the future if it became necessary."
negative,"For the price I paid I expected much better quality. I could have gone to Walmart and bought the same set for $20. The plastic buckles have broken, two upon installing. I haven’t tested the waterproof part thankfully."
negative,"The overall handle quality is excellent, and better than the one it replaced on my A.R.E. truck topper. The lock cylinder is not the best though, as you have to wiggle the key a bit to allow it to work its way past the lock tumblers. My tailgate also has a lock, but it has the type of lock cylinder with the tiny spring-loaded door, like an OEM exterior lock cylinder on any vehicle. This is probably what I should of looked for, but I doubt any T-handle out there has that.<br /><br />I'm going to try some graphite lubricant to try to make the lock cylinder smoother.<br /><br />Overall, I still like the handle, and can deal with the lock cylinder. I would still recommend it."
positive,This is a necessity for your sewer hose. Makes the flow nice and even.
positive,Item as described
negative,Didn't work. Sent back
positive,easy to use and worked great for the little bullseye crack that I had in my windshield
negative,"IT SOLVED THE PROBLEM, BUT FOR TWO PIECES OF PLASTIC AND TWO RUBBER BANDS, THE COST WAS EXHORBITANT."
positive,"I had to replace the old incandescent lights in my RV, so I chose these. Installation was a breeze but there is no indication on the switch which selection turns on one light or two, so it was necessary to test this before screwing the light into place. No biggee, but a simple icon I or II on the switch would have been nice. I have quite a few of these in my RV so for the sake of consistency I want them all oriented so that the switch actuation works the same for every light. The light is bright, no doubt about that, however it is a very bright white and great for task lighting but if you're looking for ""mood"" lighting you may want to consider a warmer light. I'll probably change the light over the dining table because of this. The other anomaly frequently mentioned in the reviews is the yellow pattern cast by the light onto whatever surface its pointed at. I'm attaching a picture of the weird effect it has on my window blinds. It also does this on the countertop. If that is bothersome then probably best to find something else without this effect. I purchased a 5-pack so I will install them in the places that need bright light. Overall the light performs as described and I'll give the a decent rating."
positive,"I like the aesthetic look and function of keeping dirt out of my RV, It does only last about a season though unless you take it off and keep it in your rig which I don't do."
positive,I like stuff to be organized  and to be all together when needed and this is a great way to keep car documents all together. It is lightweight and very well made. It is sewn very well and very nice quality. iT is also a very nice design.
positive,"This certainly isn't a &#34;cure&#34; for a damaged awning, but it does work quite well for holding it together through a weekend trip so your entire trip isn't ruined. Be sure that you have thoroughly washed and dried the area before application. It holds up pretty well!"
negative,This thing needs a youtube video on installation. The instructions are horrible. Returned without any problem and would re-purchase if there were some decent online instructions.
negative,"It seems like they have quality/manufacturing issues. The ones I got have lots of loose fibers. Entire, large pieces from the extra plush side fall out after taking them out brand new from the package. Maybe after some washings it'll stop shedding, but I have never seen this with microfiber rags before. Until they fix whatever manufacturing issues they have, best to buy something else."
negative,"Not satisfied but I'm not giving this a horrible rating only because I misread the title.  It DOES NOT FIT TRUCKS!  I really think there should be 3-4 options for this product (cars, suvs, vans, trucks) because having one size doesn't work. The picture I added is of a Silverado HD 2500 and as you can see, it only fits half of the back window.  The front window wouldn't even stay on, it slide right off."
negative,"****Update: This last set I bought didn't even make it a year.  I don't know what happened to the quality recently, but it's easy to see why Glowteck isn't selling bulbs anymore.  It's shame really because it used to be a quality product as my original review below explains.<br /><br /> This is my third set of these bulbs and I've been very pleased with their performance in every installation.<br /><br />In my 1994 Ford E-150 van and 1993 Ford F-250 installation was fairly easy but required minor trimming of the trim ring that holds the bulb in the housing.  Once installed they performed flawlessly.<br /><br />The most recent installation is in my 2000 Lincoln Town Car.  No trimming of the retaining ring was required, and the bulbs performed flawlessly as usual.<br /><br />A word about the beam pattern; these LED bulbs do not illuminate in the same way as conventional or HID bulbs.  The visible beam pattern is irregular and diffuse.  You will not be able to focus the beam in the same way as regular bulbs.  Low beam might appear to illuminate only a short distance in front of the car and high beams might seem like they're all over the place.<br /><br />Stop looking at the visible beam.  It is not a good indicator of how well the bulbs are performing. Instead look at everything else that's illuminated.  You'll be surprised at how much of the road in front of you is illuminated well beyond the visible beam.  Very well illuminated.<br /><br />Give them a week of driving and I'm sure you'll be satisfied."
positive,seems accurate ... matches the expensive gage I have
positive,I own a 2006 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner and the front mudflaps have worn (and ripped) on both sides despite the truck only being 7 years old.  I was quoted $85 by the local Toyota FOR ONE MUDFLAP and a used mudflap at a wrecking yard was $40.  These mudflaps are FAR superior to OEM and I highly recommend them.  They are slighltly shorter than the factory ones but you can't really notice any difference.  I bought the front pair and I told myself that I would also buy the rear pair if it didn't look good . . . . not necessary to do so but all 4 guards can be replaced for the price of ONE mudflap from the dealer.  Installation was easy . . . there are only 5 screws on each flap and it took 15-20 minutes to install the front pair.
positive,As expected
positive,It's very easy-to-use I think I getting my money worth and I use it a lot.
positive,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he thought i had bought him a gas pail until he opened it and then he was pleasantly surprised. He is a hunter so he really liked the concept.
positive,Nice
positive,"Bright lights easy install. After a year I notice few started to flicker, I installed on three vehicles and they started to flicker. Will wait for better product."
positive,"So far so good! Been about 2 months now, no issues."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:b16ba4421f76f2924d8b3794c48da602]] Just moved to TX and had to install a plate on the front of my Prius. Everything is included besides the drill and bits. That being said, I had no idea what I was doing and the instructions were confusing. I had a lot of anxiety about installing this and drilling into my bumper. I watched some online videos, already had a drill and bits at home, And found the largest one 3/8” made the correct size hole. From there it was simple - popping the white holders into holes, mounting the mount, then screwing the plate and face on. I used the wrong screws so I damaged my bumper, but it’s already beat up so idc. The instructions don’t clarify which screws go where. It feels sturdy and looks cool. I had to dock a star because of the poor instructions but seems like a good product."
positive,All my guests ask me where did I get this and they all love it.
positive,94 Honda Fourtrax 300 4x4<br />It fit perfectly except for the fuel line runs into the airbox piping. Had to make a 90 degree bend tight off the fuel inlet on the carb. It works but easy spot for the line to collapse and restrict fuel. Other than that it works mint. No adjustment needed just strap on and go.
positive,absolutely love it thank you
positive,Not to big not to small works fine on my Jeep.
positive,"Bought this kit for my wife’s 2014 Honda Crosstour. I consider myself pretty handy and I’ve installed brakes in the past. I wasn’t surprised by any drastic changes in braking technology and the install went about as well as it could.<br /><br />Power Stop has always had a great reputation and the price for this kit worked out to be nearly $300 cheaper than the Honda stealership. I could have bought all the components for a comparable price at the parts store but, they would have been Mia-matched brands.<br /><br />If you’re looking for brakes for your Honda, this is probably the best way to go. Even if you pay a shop to do the labor, you’ll still save money over taking it to Honda."
positive,"Bought this for my new Crosstrek, it works great, no more loud noise when I close the hatchback."
positive,"The company's write up says this will make your car more romantic.<br /> I am pretty sure my '07 Kia could never be described as romantic, no matter how you light it.<br />However, this light is good and bright, it dims off rather than just goes off, and it is very easy to install.<br />Slightly brighter than the one it was replacing in my Kia, I was able to fit this inside the cabin light container, But it is built to be installed anywhere, it has a sticky back and can mount directly onto the ceiling, if you are looking to add extra lights, not just refresh the existing one(s)"
positive,Works good Looks good Fits 2004 forester
negative,"These are very nice-looking wheels and I love them. New they look high quality. The machining is flawless and the black paint deep and rich. the clear coat also looks very deep and solid. But just as the other reviewer I have the clear coat on these wheels peel off on all of the spokes of the wheel. I am in the South and the truck never sees any road salt. I also do not drive on unpaved roads, but it seems that after a certain time the clear coat cracks and lifts off from the painted surface. Again, it is just the clear coat that peels off, not the actual black paint underneath it. Other reviews indicate that this is not an isolated issue but occurs frequently with this model after some time. I have not contacted Vision Wheels yet, but will do so and update this review when I hear back from them."
positive,Looks good. Not as tinted as it looks when looking through it while installed
positive,Must have tool for brake work.
positive,Worked perfectly
positive,"Don't want my BT dongle to wear out, so I bought this. Seems well made so I think it will do the job I intend it to do."
positive,i can’t stop getting compliments on this bumper sticker. looks great on my 1998 saturn s series
positive,"It is easy to install and use, make sure you let water run through it when you first open it to remove the charcoal dust.  I use it for an RV and like that I am introducing filtered water into the fresh water supply and the water heater.  I will continue to use this product and believe it is a good value."
positive,"This is by far the best value for my money and most useful thing I’ve ever bought in Amazon. During weekdays, My minivan is my bedroom and this shades gives me the whole new level of satisfaction every time I go to sleep in the back seat."
positive,Great addition to my drybox/cooler. Wonderful conversational starter and great way to show your personality.  Easy to adhere to a clean surface.
positive,You never really know how much dirt you're scraping onto your car until you wash your car after the salt and sand have been cleared from the roads. There was so much dirt in the bottom that these grit traps prevent from getting back into your sponges and towels.  This is a great idea. I highly recommend.
positive,Very happy
positive,Good product
positive,"Seems to be made well, no problems, worked great and fast."
positive,"Have been through several different chargers, so far so good! Good value for the $$ if it holds up"
positive,great
negative,Better fans out there for the price. Switch was the cheapest I've ever seen.
positive,"Pros-<br />Super easy and smooth to insert. There are side protection so the interior doesn’t get scratched.<br />The mat helps items not slip back.<br />Doesn’t cover the ports below.<br />Smooth transition. It looks like it came as part of the car.<br />Does give you extra space.<br /><br />Cons-<br />You can only use for super thin items. My iPhone pro max with a Loopy case does not fit.<br /><br />What fits?<br />I’ve attached a few pictures to show you more or less what fits. My garage door opener is a super tight squeeze.<br />My badge fits with the lanyard but I have a expandable lanyard with the clip and that doesn’t fit.<br />I have a key card for the garage and elevator for my job And it’s nice to have easy access to it.<br />A notepad/sticky notes fit.<br /><br />So unless you have super thin items you need in your car for easy access, I wouldn’t purchase it.<br /><br />I have a 2021 Toyota RAV4."
positive,"I use this in all of my cars and motorcyles.  This stuff really works.  My gas mileage has increased at least slightly after a treatment, the engine, transmission, and steering all work just a bit smoother also.  I recommend this to everyone that owns an internal combustion vehicle!!"
negative,"I love the product but a couple key things: I had a plumber and garage junkie install it. Good thing because there was no spacer included so we installed the bracket upside down to make it fit. Also the hoses and the clamps are the same width. We had to grind the hose down a bit to make it fit, then use sealant. Let’s not forget the Vaseline!<br />I think this can will perform well, but installation was a beast!"
positive,"Overnite, inexpensive.<br /><br />Works great."
negative,"does not fit snugly at all, kind of dangles back there (the straps to the headrest are at the furthest out and the shortest length and still it's not tight / snug.  Packaging is gone so can't really return it but I wish I'd saved my $15"
positive,"These fit my 2020 Subaru Outback perfectly. They give me privacy and block the sun. They can not be used if you roll down your window. Even a cracked window won't let air in. They fit pretty snuggly in the window frame. They don't go all the way down to the small cor er window, but it is nice to have a little visibility."
positive,work well
positive,Bought this for my Kawasaki ZRX. Fits perfectly and works fantastic. Bought a spare for the future.
positive,Well made. Good fit. Arrived early
positive,Just what I needed!
positive,This stuff is my go to when nothing else works  - and it always works
positive,These rotors fit like a glove and are working great. They were well recommended and I am quite happy<br />in my purchase of them.
positive,Great to take along needed items when going by bike. Well made with lots of room👍🏻
negative,"You get what you pay for. These are cheap, really cheap... The ends collapsed and popped off"
positive,Very happy with purchase and performance. I've had them installed for over a week now and no issues.
positive,"My main regret for our home is the kitchen counters are way too small.  Part is in an almost accessible corner, (the stand mixer stays there between uses).  The counter on either side of the stove is only 14"" wide, and the remaining sections on either side of the sink is about 2 feet each.  We bought a cart for the microwave , but two people can just barely work together at the same time.<br />This covers the stove exactly, it simply lifts off if the stove is needed, and allows extra room for preparation."
positive,Fits perfect and colors were bright
positive,Cute sticker! Beautiful colors! Fast shipping! Great seller!
positive,Works great
negative,"This is seriously bad! There’s at least a foot gap of space above the shade and another foot of too much on sides, there’s absolutely no way to make this stay up, doesn’t come near the sun visors to hold it up either. Whoever measured this and called it BMW i3 fit should learn how to measure."
positive,"There is a trick to putting these on. Get someone to do it for you!<br />Well, leverage is the trick, but caution is needed to prevent damage to the steering wheel.<br />This, however, is true of every cover I have ever seen.<br /><br />Once installed it is very comfortable to use and prevents your hand from welding itself to your steering wheel on hot days."
positive,"I put these covers on my Mule 4010 trans.  They fit well,and look good."
positive,My only concern is durability in South Florida hot and humid weather.  Easy fit and value for OEM replacement. Time will tell if materials can outlast the hot temperatures that baked the factory equipment.
positive,These are fantastic! Protects the floors very well!
positive,Pretty much what I expected
positive,"This is so unique and adorable! It came with the scented disc's to insert inside of them. I couldn't really tell what the fragrance was because I didn't open the package due to me already having air fresheners, so that's why I only gave it 3 stars. But regardless of that, I like it mostly for decoration."
positive,"People saying this 16ga cable is not thick enough for charging their vehicle.<br />This cable is made by Battery Tender for use with their 1.25A trickle charger.<br />If you want to permanently install battery leads on multiple vehicles for use with your one Battery Tender charger then this is what you want. It is more than enough wire guage for the 14V 1.25A maximum charge current of the Battery Tender.<br />But no, it won’t fast charge your dead battery at 50A! Neither will 12AWG.<br />Battery Tender is a great product with 10 yr warranty. The cable accessories are excellent quality also."
positive,"I received these mats quickly and couldn’t wait to install them.  They feel like butter...so soft! Installation was super easy. The beige color is a great match for my seats.<br /><br />As you see on my “before” pictures, my seats are beginning to stretch and age.  So to protect them, these covers are awesome."
negative,The cover I received is black.
positive,This is decent trash bin. The size makes it fit well in any vehicle. The way it pops open means you fit more in it than you would think.
positive,"I like the look as much as my friends tease me about Castle Greyskull and He Man. Anyway, looks good. Quality is good but I have noticed that their products are not like Harley quality when it comes to chrome.<br />Instal is fairly easy."
positive,Looks great and very durable.
positive,Dealer wanted about $50 to replace my cabin filter.  I watched about 4 videos on youtube on how to install it and it took me about 10 minutes to finish the job.  Fits exactly like old filter.  I have about 20K on my van and I couldn't believe all the dirt and debris in the old filter.
negative,Not as nice as I thought they’d be. The sticky tape it comes with is strong but no way I’d use it on leather.  Guess I’ll add material to the outer sides to make them look nicer.
positive,Easy to install. Looks great!
positive,"Bought this quite some time ago and the first time I used it the battery was dead. Finally got to use it today and it is very easy to use, the display is easy to read during the day in the shade. You need to make sure that you store it so the on button doesn't get pushed as the case is relatively soft."
positive,Good for price
positive,Allowed me to make an adjustable drag link.  Nice product.
negative,Bad quality rubber gaskets
positive,Great product!!!
positive,Great quality products. Great seller!
positive,Great stick matte finish
positive,"This tool is great. Worked good to remove my aftermarket innovators west harmonic balancer from my C5 corvette. If there is a down fall it's that the instructions aren't the best. Other than that, I give this product 5 stars."
positive,"Good, it does help in filling up the batteries"
positive,works good and looks good aside from the one dent in the lid and the three in the sides. Bad packaging
positive,Excellent fit! I ordered this part as the screws broke on the old one and the mirror spun about freely. Dealer quoted me $300 for a replacement. Ordered this and did the work in about 10 minutes. Super easy to install.
negative,The pockets are useless.  They begin to get stretched and won't hold items in place.
negative,"I really wanted to believe that some of the negative reviews were just for people that griped for no reason. But after my first use, I can see why they complain. If you barely touch the treaded part of your tire, the foam will start to rip apart. To correctly use these, you must have very very flat sidewalls (no MT tires) and LIGHTLY brush the tires with your choice of tire shine. Good thing they have a two pack otherwise this would be a one star product."
positive,Less expensive than many other VW calipers out there.  I was a little leery due to the much lower price of these but so far when using the brakes the vehicle does indeed stop (which is a plus+).
positive,Great product would recommend buying. Fast and great shipping. Package was packet very well. It worked very well.
positive,Good!
positive,Use more better adhesive!<br /><br />Be absolutely sure:<br />ADHESIVE is equal thickness and the surface is perfectly level and square!<br />Use UV PROTECTION AND SHIELD IF POSSABLE!
negative,"These did not give me any better light quality or distance. I took my wife on a road test with the factory bulbs to get a base line, switched them out and took the same route and both of us were questioning if I had even done anything. I bought them to replace the H11B bulbs in my 2015 Kia Sportage.<br /><br />I could not see any further and the light looked the exact same. I even put back in one of the factory bulbs and did a side by side comparison and could not tell a difference.<br /><br />This product advertises &#34;Xtra technology produces better color contrast and depth perception allowing drivers to see farther&#34; & &#34;These bulbs will provide a brilliant Xtreme cool white light that will light up road hazards and street signs long before a normal halogen bulb&#34;. Both of these are not true in my case and confirmed by my wife. Not really sure how they even advertise the bulbs as &#34;white&#34; because they certainly  are not an improvement over the OEM bulb<br /><br />Really disappointed in this product and returned it."
positive,"We installed this on a post near our hot tub steps, works great to use when getting in and out"
positive,Be sure you know the rating of your chassis.
positive,"Great product, unfortunately had to return due to lack of clearance between rail system and tonneau cover."
positive,Fixed my 08 pathfinder after losing the original in the woods.
positive,A bit pricey but it works.  The tapered connection is also better than the original.  No slow vapor leak errors any more.
positive,"I only used the low pressure core remover, but everything fit well and removed the core after a couple tries  Better then losing all your refrigerant.."
positive,"I am using this shower head in my house's bathroom with a nose that has water flow control feature,<br />it can provide such high water flow! i am really liking it,<br />the material used for this item is decent, its not spectacular but its not cheap either.<br />i have not used the water stop valve built into it yet,<br />i heard that's where some of the other people's complain about this item comes from.<br /><br />2 weeks in, i am really enjoying this shower head and having no problem at all!"
positive,Problem solved! Thank you
positive,great product. no complaint
positive,I went with the bias ply due to weight. These are much lighter than the radials. I'm running H1 wheels and needed to save weight on the tires as a result. I've only been stuck once and that's because I was high centered. Tires weren't touching the ground to do their job. I do drive these on the road too. For the size of tire and for what they were build for I have no complaints. If you use them on the road just be warned they do not handle wheel on wet roads. But that goes for every aggressive mud tire I have ever seen.
negative,Used 1 time and as soon as I went to remove it it ripped. Very cheaply made.
negative,Easy to use but is a low quality product.
positive,"Ordered for a 2017 Audi Q5 2.0 Premium that needed the Service Due! message cleared from the DIC. Changing the service interval in MMI will not clear this message. I put in the ANCEL, followed app directions, and on first try the message was cleared. Easy to understand and and use. Saves me the trip and the expense to Audi. Thanks!"
positive,Has good suction I was pleasantly surprised!
negative,"I was excited to get these for my new car, until I opened the box, and the smell of musky mildew hit me in the face!  I've tried to let them air out, but the odor is so strong that it's stinking up my apartment, so I'm certainly not going to put them in my car!  Terribly disappointed!"
positive,Super cute and simple.
negative,Much smaller than I was hoping for.
positive,"I use this tire on both front and rear of my 06 zx10-r.... On a regular basis I will ride the bike through all sorts of rainy and sunny days. I only bother to slow down if the water is puddling due to heavy rainfall. Steady rains that just make the roads wet are nothing. Heavy rains that cause minor flooding, I personally choose to slow down. These tires are impressive. I feel like the bike rides smoother and better with them."
positive,"I needed to rebuild the harness for the factory fog lights on my 2007 Jeep Compass, and these worked perfectly."
positive,Great Value for our home garage
positive,Works as well as any I have had in the past for half the cost.
positive,"Used to clean all my vent covers.  Threw it in the washing machine and it looks brand new and ready to use next month.  Definitely the best brush I could have found.  Soft, durable and well made."
negative,"I finally decide to us the item and realize the function power was not good at all, and 3 minutes later it stop working on me."
positive,Easy to install.  No tape so they will never come unfastened.  They look and perform exceptionally.  Highly recommend.
positive,'worked like a champ
positive,I have used Aero wipers and they wear/ work well.
negative,Don’t snap in
negative,"Difficult to install, they don’t look very study, don’t seem to fit well either"
positive,"My leather chair was a soft supple leather that accepted the balm exceptionally well. There were pee stains and grease stains from the back of a person's head on the chair and with minimal cleaning and using this product I was able to bring back the natural luster and uniform appearance of the leather. My mother-in-law had given me the chair because she could not handle the stains and I have given it back as a brand new chair. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends and family. In fact I already have , my mother help me in restoring the chair so she knows just how good it works. Thank you for a fantastic product."
positive,Perfect fit quick change out
negative,Only used it twice but on the third try it ripped at the seams while casually putting it on. Like wearing Toilet Paper.<br /><br />If I had worn Waxed Paper it would have lasted longer.
positive,These license plate frames are really cute! I love bling so I knew I would love these! They are easy to install & look so nice! They also come with a couple extra rhinestones just in case you have any come off. But I haven’t had any problems with mine.
positive,Works as described.
positive,"Fits the space perfectly and is super sturdy. My only complaint is that it doesn’t tilt forward so the phone sits at an awkward upward angle. Still a great buy, love the tray."
positive,Took awhile to get but seems to hold just fine.
positive,"fits my Tesla model 3 ,good quality, no complaints"
positive,Guess I didn't read before I bought these. They are cool as all get out but they dont just slide in. You have to take your grill cover off and clip them in but it takes some pushing to get them to clip.
positive,"Perfect fit, and quality was good.  Only time will tell now."
positive,Momma’s dream for me was to someday live in a house without wheels. That’s never going to happen.  Make the best of it and get these nice covers to spruce up your spare.
positive,Holds my sunglasses snugly and safely on my visor.
positive,"This is a good way to suction out dents.  It worked on one spot, however it didn't work for another.  I think because it is not on a flat surface.  It was worth a try and at least I got one dent out."
negative,UGLY!!!!  Not as represented in the pictures - NOT an equal to the Hyundai product - does not have the holes to lock them in place for the front. Very harsh feeling and not very good looking.  Too much of a hassle to return but definitely would NOT recommend!!!!
positive,Quality
positive,Fit perfectly. Easy to install. Love it.
positive,I used it to pit my masks in there since I still use some. It was very easy to put in the visor and was easy to put my masks in. I would recommend if you looking to put tissues or masks in the holder.
positive,"On rangers it uses door latch screws, or snap for cloth door. Very easy to install, will need a torx t40 to install."
positive,This starter was very easy to install
positive,"Part arrived the most quickly of all the places we attempted to order it from.  My college age son was able to install this himself.  He is not a mechanic, but he is not afraid to attempt a fix on broken things.  The part worked perfectly, and he was able to pass his car inspection."
positive,"Well I have now put about 400 miles on this seat and I am loving it! We bought a sportster to share, I ride a sport bike but my wife likes the cruiser, then she decided she didn't really want to ride. So I wasn't going to let the bike go to waste and I ride it a lot more then I thought I would. The bad thing is I'm 6ft 240lbs so the stock seat killed my bum. I looked all over and everyone kept coming back to this seat. I'm glad to say it is worth every penny and then some! Very comfortable for me and as it breaks in more and more it feels better and better! I would recommend this seat to anyone and everyone! I havenb't even touched my sport bike in weeks because I'm loving the ride on the sportster with this seat!"
negative,"None of the advertisement pictures show them unfolded for size. I am disappointed they are small. I have several I have used as dish towels. Mine are getting worn so I decided to replace them with these, but they are about large washcloth size and thinner than expected. I'm disappointed."
positive,"This stuff works great for water spot removal on my Car. You MUST follow directions on the label,"
negative,Rather cheap.  Add to add tape to fit our receiver but it's still in the receiver.  Works for what we need it to do.
positive,perfect! no flaws but I ended up sending back
positive,Simple design that will last a long time. makes cleaning dirtbike chain super easy. i have only seen the plastic ones at the bike stores... so the aluminum version is a bonus!
positive,"It removed what I assumed were permenant white marks on my black BWM X3 leather seats. Satin finish, not greasy or waxy."
positive,Use this on the wheels on my F150. Works just fine. Holding up well. Great buy and great shipping.
negative,"They were brighter than stock headlamps when working, i will say that.  But i installed these in two cars, and three of the four bulbs were burnt out within six months.  Ouch.  I don't know if the fan failed and LEDs overheated or what.  In one of the cars i was also worried the light pattern might be blinding other drivers.  I am trying out a different brand now"
positive,"I firste saw its usage on YouTube and thought, &#34;What a great idea!&#34; INobody local knew anything about them, so I. found them at Amazon  and tghey work just as the YouTube video, GREAT!"
positive,These look nice and fit well but on one of them the light keeps going out. Not sure what exactly the problem is.
positive,my son is a USFS wildland firefighter--- and his boots need constant attention so they stay in working shape for every fire and every new season.  Have used this oil for years!  He relies on his boots in the hottest of fires- and they stay suple and soft while doing what they need to do....protect my son!  Its the only oil he uses on his  boots.
positive,"Nice little holder, but it does fit a bit awkwardly on my van visor (Chrysler town and country).  It does the job though."
positive,"This sure beats the heck out of the $300 Ford wanted to charge me for 20 lug nuts + install!!  Crazy people!!! Lol.  Anyway these go on easy and are a bit narrower than my old ones but was able to easily scratch the paint off a few.  It doesn't look bad but one kind of does.. has a big scratch on it now.  Still, not bad for the price!"
negative,"Ok, so while it does what it's suppose to do, it is HIGHLY ANNOYING. When ever I take off/hit  a bump it doesn't like it beeps/goes off. Of course I have to hear this the whole ride as  not going to stop to shut this thing off."
positive,Perfect fit for my 2013 Elantra. Came in just in time. Same day it came in it was going to start raining. Put it over my car and the next day it was perfect. The material looks and feels tough. Had it for a few weeks now and a few storms later. The cover still looks good as new. Love this car cover. Even comes with a bag to tuck it away and a lock.
positive,"Unbelievable how bright they turned my wife's Journeys high beams,  it's like going from low to high,  I should of done this awhile ago"
positive,Great lights at a great price. Nice and white.
positive,This is what you want! OEM Parts
positive,Easy to set time
positive,Made of good materials. Shipped on time.<br />Measurements were about two inches short on the width but we can live with that as the price was much cheaper than others.
positive,Much less expensive than OEM.  Same quality.
positive,Works as it should. Would recommend
positive,Great! I never have to hold it out with my hand again. My original Velcro went to a different car so this is great when you're sharing a pass.
negative,They were so nice but I could not get them to stay on.
positive,This has a nice shine that last a few weeks in the summer.  Not to slippy or too shinny.  Doesn't attract dust.  Longevity is about 3 weeks.
positive,Suv
positive,nice and easy to use.  I use it on everything but glass.
positive,I have used this in the past it works great especially on older leather items. Rick
positive,"If you want a cat sticker for your cat, this one does the job just fine.  My wife has had one on her car window for a couple of years and it's still there and looking good."
positive,Work great and low power pull
positive,I liked the angle of the snow removal tool. It is curved and makes it easier to remove snow from the windshield and roof of my car.
positive,Product was as good as they said it would be.
positive,"Well made metal gasket for an great oem fit, especially if modifying from a donut gasket to a flanged exhaust header or manifold."
positive,works good
positive,Fits well and works as it should
positive,If you have a fuse that blows every so often or you want to put fuse in a vital fuse like fuel pump power these are perfect. Like most cars you have to lay upside down under the dash let you know fast what blew . Or like me power to rear lights that blows when trailer plugs in saves time agrevation
positive,"its a pack of t pipes, and they all look fine and work fine."
positive,Fit great on 2009 650R and work great.
negative,This motor only lasted a month.
negative,Didn't work
positive,Works fine.  Quality seems good.  Would buy again.
positive,Holds my big Stainless Steel Cup/Jug and coffee cup both without any tipping. Needed to free up a cup holder for my passenger for an upcoming long road trip and this was PERFECT!! Would recommend to anyone.
positive,I’m happy with the item I ordered.
positive,Denso has always made good electronics. This part is no exception. It immediately turned off the &#34;Check Engine&#34; light in my car!
positive,Good Price for synthetic motor oil
positive,Worked well
negative,THE CONTENTS MAY WORK IF POURED ONTO THE DAMP CLOTH.................
positive,"Ordered the collapsible kennel with Spring starting. Kennel arrived in one piece, would say this is easy to set up but, you do have to use some force to get the (two) set of brackets connected each time you use it. Spacious enough for my medium size dogs. The exterior is made with a great durable material, felt the Jeep logo could be stitched with higher quality finish for the price. Frame welding finish (looking inside the unzipped kennel) isnt the greatest but it definitely feels light with solid construction. Two reasons i can't give it a five star rating, but great travel accessory for any trip with medium sized pets."
positive,Excellent AAAAAAAAA ++++++++
positive,"I'll update later, but for now right after arrival:<br />It looks good.<br />It runs big, I usually wear XL and this L is a bit big on me. I am 5-10 and 190 pounds with a 43"" chest and I probably could have worn a M over a shirt. This will work over a sweater, it is for winter. If you don't plan to wear this in the winter, you might order a size under."
negative,"Cost is good for what you get. The directions are a copy of a copy of China to English translation. This is a nice setup if it is used on a farm or personal use,  but not for a mechanic working his tools every day.<br /><br />Your opinions may differ.<br /><br />Good luck"
positive,Easy installation and works great
positive,Don't know how I've lived without this!  Great to put my phone and drink right next to me.  It also catches any change or small things that would normally drop between the seats.  This seat organizer is made well and looks like a high end leather product.
negative,"Returning because it did not block signals from our 2014, 2015, and 209 Honda vehicles. I thought it would work after seeing thousands of reviews; but maybe it works on older cars."
positive,"I bought these for under cabinet lighting on a 10' section of counter space in an Airstream travel trailer.  I am very satisfied in the style and quality of the lights.  I have them on a dimmer switch and they dim beautifully through a wide range of brightness.  I did give them five stars, despite the fact that they're considerably dimmer when set to as bright as they can go than my other overhead lights in my trailer.  However, it would be unfair to strike a star for that since I custom built the overhead LED lights and purposefully made them with the ability to put out a lot of light when on high.  Comparably, these don't stand a chance, but for my application as under cabinet lighting they're probably about perfect.  Would highly recommend these as reading lights, under cabinet lighting, closet lighting, extra lighting in a vehicle, etc.  I don't think that these are that great for general lighting.  Perhaps, if you had a lot of them, you could get away with it, but you'd likely have to litter up your ceiling with them.  They look nice, but having them every two feet would be a little odd looking.,<br /><br />Not disappointed for my application, hence the five stars, but be aware before you consider them for lighting up larger spaces."
positive,Works good and at a very good pric3
negative,"I ordered these was told that they would fit my vehicle, but they did not."
positive,The best stuff out
positive,"Used last year as oil for my motorcyle, it's a Honda Fury 2011.  Ran great all year, and it's so much less than other full synthetic oils.  Using it again this year."
positive,"Pain to install, but looks good."
negative,I bought this because I have the non-perforated Sonic 2.0 and love that jacket.  This one fit totally different.  Sleeves were longer and narrower that the non-perf one I have.  It was really tight around the forearm.  Sent it back.
positive,Works  great on car even in thuderstorms haven't  flew off or roped love the 5 tie down system  ordered  another 1.
positive,"I got this about a year ago, have used it several times. Small enough to keep in my glove box, works every time. Have used it on my car and a bunch of the guys at work have &#34;borrowed&#34; it for a few minutes to get a better idea what their problem was"
negative,I thought I’m getting 10 for $6 .. but only 5pieces .. over price.. will not buy again
positive,Great product
negative,"Crazy strong clear tape almost like 3M film, super hard to work with and get bubble free. I used this to protect parts of a mountain bike frame, but after a few rides it would just get dirt in the corners and start to come off. I could never get the bubbles out of it and I have a lot of experience with vinyl and the 3M wraps.  I would probably go the 3M route in the future way easier to work with."
positive,"Just got it and updated it..more to come!<br />!!UPDATE!!<br />First I bought the flashcal, took it straight home and registered/updated it, do this before you use it. I took it out to my jeep and made a few adjustments as far as tire size and pressure (TPMS.) Noticed the correction in performance immediately. There are a lot of options this will correct as you make changes to your jeep and there are a few frivolous things you can change as well.<br />Happy with everything I went back in and ran the updater again and purchased the warranty and the upgrade to flashpaq because it's in the flashpaq where you affect changes to the tuning of your jeep. So I bought my 2012 rubi unlim. used and found out that it actually came from Canada and whomever owned it up there had used a flashpaq on it as well because the one I had wouldn't make and changes being a different s/n and all. I called customer support and within a day and a couple emails I had my tuning fixed. Now this is where you need to know that if you buy a used flashpaq/flashcal it will be locked to whatever the vin is for the vehicle it came from and you will have to pay for them to fix it. Not fair if you ask me because its not your fault that it's vinlocked but it is your fault if you knowingly buy a used one. I recommend buying it direct from superchips or a verified re-seller. Customer service from superchips is top-line."
negative,Exactly the right part but overpriced
positive,"I watched the video two or three times, by the third time, i understood what to do.  My car is in the shop right now, so when i get it back, i will try the EzyShade Windshield Snow cover.  I am sure i can put it on with no problem.  Thanks for the video!<br />I just put the EZ shade on; it is so easy to put on thanks to the video which clearly shows you how!  Wow! Great product!"
positive,I added some high heat spray paint around where the old muffler had rusted through hopefully prolonging the life of this new one. Installation was easy and fit my 11 Cube perfectly.
positive,This is a professional kit that was bought and will be used by a professional mechanic.<br /><br />I will update with any pros/cons.<br /><br />Update 9/2017: All pros no cons simply a great kit for daily use on any rear screw pistons!!
positive,Looks good fits pretty good
positive,Works great.  Thanks
positive,Perfect!
positive,"Product arrived as scheduled.  It is easy to use.  I cannot rate durability high at this time, as I just used the product.  I am hopeful it will last a long time."
positive,"I like this charger, but was disappointed that it only comes with a set of charging clamps.  I have a smaller noco charger with x-connect accessories, but this much larger and more expensive unit is not compatible with the x-connect accessories due to having a totally different sized connector.  There is an x-connect label on the back of the box of this G26000 charger but it is not compatible.  I was disappointed in that.  I am trying to discuss this via email with NOCO."
positive,"Solid tube, very thick.  Fit perfect on a PW50."
positive,"Soft material, hold suds well. Mothers makes very good products imo"
positive,"Omg, this is the best cleaner/protector for our RV.  It removed road dirt and bugs better than soap/water. It gives a beautifully mirrored shine that remains for months.  We have used on rubber seals around slides and makes them look new.  Once I have a few used towels, I wipe down the wheels/tires!<br />I won’t use anything else!"
positive,Loved it
positive,"Great service from Amazon my body shop still had not called me, I went on Amazon and toy shock i go 2 day delivery, Amazon was faster by 5 days from what I thought. Good price. Walmart installed it for $12.00. I tell everyone everyday that I am so satisfied with my purchases from Amazon. I just received my 2nd one 5 days early."
positive,"Shipped and arrived on time, easy to put together and the setup was also easy."
positive,"Perfect fit, look great and what a difference in the ride."
negative,Broke off second use
positive,Does not fit on model y. Good for other SUVs or sedans.
positive,"used this to put the glass in my 53 chevy truck,  worked great."
positive,This stands out on our cars and looks neat and definitely lets folks know what my handicap plates only partially show. Thanks
negative,I was super disappointed that this doesn't completely cover the light.  I think it will block most stones but I don't understand why it isn't just a bit bigger.  That being said it fits very securely
positive,"Thing works well. You can't use the impact gun on the jack as you would expect but it works.<br /><br />When the jack comes down, it comes down uncontrollably quickly but it's ok."
positive,I had to order this replacement seal because i damage the old one.It worked great with no more fluid leaking. It was the exact replacement.
negative,THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT COVER FABRIC !
negative,"Three element LED, very small,  kind of silly, not sure I'll use them."
negative,This pump is very slow (pumps small amount per shot).  The hoses kept coming off and I had to purchase a hose clamp to finish my transfer.  This product is not for anyone who does not have a lot of time.<br /><br />It does pump tranny grease just fine but with a great deal of effort.  My machine took three quarts and it took me more than a half hour to pump that much.
positive,Great! Finally got some led bulbs that are as bright as the bulbs they replace
positive,"So simple, convenient & practical, I love these things.  Kept 2 & gave 2 to my daughter.  I love that i dont have to put my bag on the floor!"
positive,"This is great! The skeleton pic is sealed in a clear, see through type of resin or polymer(?) attached to the bolt head! Not a cheesy stud with a sticker that will come off the first time you wash it. As well, the screw thread is timed just right to position the skeleton so that it's properly facing the rear, letting anyone looking from the rear know not to mess with your scooter!<br /><br />Finger tight gets it aligned all but 3/4 of the way for me. Take a pair of standard pliers, (NOT a pair of vice-grips or channel-locks), open them to the wide position and use the teeth meant to bite on something (the middle of the jaw, not the ends) to grab the head of the bolt hard enough it won't slip, but not so hard you bite into the knurled head damaging it. Grip it tight but ""DON'T SLIP""! Now turn it another 3/4 turn until it's lined up with the seat, the fender, and facing the rear. Trust me, it'll be torqued enough to stay in and not fall out. Done!<br /><br />Using the stock Harley seat-bolt in the rear fender should work as above, because it should be the one machined to fit one way in the hole/slot in the rear fender that keeps it from turning while tightening. If it doesn't line up properly, look to see how much farther it needs to turn and which way to line up the skeleton properly. Then unscrew it making sure to keep the nut in it's current position and not let it fall to the floor by reaching up under the fender to hold it in place while unscrewing. ""This is important"".<br /><br />Once it's unscrewed, lower the nut just a little being careful to hold it's position. ""Don't turn it"" and lose the position it was in. Now turn the nut left or right ""only as far as needed"" so the skeleton will be lined up when tightened down.<br /><br />Hold it there and re-tighten the seat-bolt, keeping the nut in said position. This is what's called ""timing the threads"" so that the head of the seat-bolt is lined up when tightened down so the skeleton faces the rear. Enjoy!!!"
positive,"Just what I wanted, easily installed, but the plastic endcaps were all cracked and broken.  They still went on the exposed ends, but all were not in new condition.  Each of the 4 endcaps were cracked in some location."
positive,"Great quality product. Very bright. It was a little difficult to install on 2015 Dodge Challenger. Difficult to get the bulb into the grove pattern to secure the bulb and then once it was in, it was a bit hard to twist the bulb into place. Seems that the pattern on the O.E.M. bulb compared to the LED bulb were slightly different, which i am sure its done to fit different cars with similar patterns.But fit nice and snug once it was in."
positive,Good tough brush guard. Easy to install just need ratchet straps or else your gonna have a tough time.
positive,My JEEP Grand Cherokee WK2 was SO NOISY from the hitch moving around inside the receiver. This simple fix resolved the issue 100% by applying downward torque that mimics constant tongue weight.
negative,Ok
negative,The item works very well till you try to unscrew the air hose then you will lose around 25% of the air out of your bike's tire. I guess it was not designed to work with bikes tires because it doesn't have a quick release and you can only unscrew it
positive,drives the bike forward as designed
positive,"It is not a perfect windshield repair kit, but, it made the starburst chip on my windshield less noticeable. It's not completely gone, but better than it was."
positive,"I have eyelashes on my vehicle and have for years, which has inspired other folks in the family to want some attached to their vehicles. We were not able to find the same type I have but we took a chance on these. They're much longer and have so much attitude. They're adorable. So far they've held up well and we'll see how they do in hot year round sun, but they've made the family member who got them so tickled. Would recommend."
positive,Seems a bit over kill. I think I could have squirted oil into the high side with this monster.
positive,Love the product
positive,"Purchased this to replace a headlight bulb in my 2006 Saab 9-3, saving me at least $150 from having the dealer fix it.  Checked out an online video showing how to swap out bulbs and in less than ten minutes all was operational again.  The light is clear and bright--can hardly tell a difference between this bulb and the original Saab bulb in the other headlight.  Hopefully it proves to be long lasting."
positive,This was a super easy install and perfect fit for my 2011 Tundra Platinum Crew Max. Most of the weather stripping on the vehicle was starting to dry rot and eventually melted onto my front passenger window one blazing hot summer day (I live in South Louisiana). I believe my father in law and I had them replaced in under 20 minutes while talking the whole time.
positive,Inexpensive yet perfect replacement for OEM. Went in with no problems. Quality was excellent.
negative,I loved it. Thanks
positive,Not bad! Started replacing the bulbs in my travel trailer...they are not quite as bright as my standard bulbs but very good...they run cooler and take less power which is very important when running on battery power only!
positive,Great bang for my buck works great
negative,Wrong size they dond fit
positive,Use it to swipe my sweat off during my workout. I love it.
positive,I really like it. It feels nice and it looks good. It has a good and comfortable grip.
positive,"Arrived on time,packaged nicely and easy to open. Perfect fit. Just what was needed"
positive,It is a genuine part as described.
negative,These are ridiculously chunky & ugly and do not light up as the picture suggests.
positive,Fits very nicely in my 2017 Escape.
positive,Beautiful parts would definitely recommend purchasing Google the video how to do it and enjoy the look once it’s done
positive,"For a minute or two it smells like 3-in1 oil, but then the smell goes away. The product itself works very well. It seems to firm up the leather."
positive,Very nice! Heavy but not to heavy. Feels like a nice solid watch. I have a large wrist and its a tiny bit big on me. The clasp is exceptional. You have to release it by squeezing both sides of the latch. Very well made. Simple but elegant.
positive,"Great car sticker - it has survived a long, cold winter here in the UP on my husband's Nissan Frontier."
positive,I use them in my Jeep. So convenient with doors & top on or off. Keeps my purse from rattling around on the floorboards.
positive,It's a PCV valve grommet. What's to say?
negative,"We purchased this for a 2009 Chevy Suburban I believe (we have a dealership and buy a lot of parts) and it didn’t fix the issue, we ended up having to get the part from another supplier."
positive,"It will take me a little time to get these mounted but a quick test shows they have a narrow path, spot light, and are bright as day. Add the fact that they can switch between yellow and white is great. Been many days I have left for work at 430am and be clear at my house, 2 miles down the road its foggy and wet. These will help so much."
positive,"I purchased this to have on hand in the event I needed to get a battery charged.  So far, I have only had to use it to charge the battery of my riding lawn mower.  The charger itself is very light and looks almost like a toy but it works very well.  It is very easy to use and I am very glad I purchased this product"
positive,"So far so good!! Just put them in.  Super easy took less than 5 minutes. Hope they last, but they look awesome.  In fact they look like it came with the car."
positive,Great product fits my vehicle perfectly.
positive,Thick but easy to cut looks good easy to clean
positive,This thing is so magnetic I actually had a bit of trouble getting it to go in without sticking on the oil pan.  It will be nice to pull out any loose metal.
positive,"Nice little document holder! I like this because now I have my registration and insurance in one nice, neat place, and I'll never misplace it or have to rifle through things to find it if I'm pulled over."
negative,The blades leaving streaks
positive,Floor mats fit my Kia Sorento like a glove. Couldn’t be happier!
positive,"These are decent, but nothing special. The price is at the higher end of glove, and for the money you can probably find a better value in glove. I bought them, I wear them, but they're not something I'd buy again for this price. Per the size chart, I got an XXL, but I should have ordered a XL because they stretch so much they've gone up a full size as they break in.  There's a lot of loose material inside the glove, and long term (2+ hour) comfort is not great."
negative,looks cool but doesn't cover your entire license plate. Which sucks.
positive,"This works great on my Suzuki Boulevard C50. It was easy to install, and its been months now and no leaks. K&N is always great!"
positive,Better than originally
positive,Was fine
positive,"Got size 12/14 and it fits my small-framed, skinny 12 year old perfectly. Probably runs slightly small if you have a bigger child.<br />Fabulous looking. He has been dirt-biking with these 3 weekends in a row and is loving them, even in the hot Florida heat.<br />One thing that is helpful is that the crotch pads have velcro and are removable... that is convenient.<br />Love O'Neal products."
negative,The product came with no instructions.  The items were folded in the package leaving creases and marks in the leather. Would not buy again
negative,"Did the job, but difficult to fit cord back in case and it gets hot when airing up things."
positive,"August Auto Heavy Duty 4pcs Universal Fit Rubber Car Floor Mats, for Cars, SUVs, Truck, Vans are truly superior floor mats. They are made of a heavy duty rubber and are designed with enough grooved channels to protect your vehicle from both water and snow, of which we get an abundance here in the Midwest. These fit perfectly in our GMC SUV- both in the front and rear without needing to trim them. But, should you need to trim them, they are designed to trim them along the channels and still maintain a beautiful design. The back of the mats have an anti-slip backing, which is really nice, so they don’t move. They are easy to lift and shake out without spilling the water everywhere. Wonderful, non-slip, heavy duty mats that keep the water in the channels until you shake them out. 5 STARS."
positive,Fits well. Wipes clean.
positive,"Great looking hat, my husband looks great in this hat. I bought him the Same brad hat in another style and it looks great too. My husband finds hats are normally too big but this one fit perfect. We ordered s/m"
positive,"I grabbed this from Amazon as a part of my battery rehab on my 1998 Ford Explorer Limited with the 302 V8.  I picked this vehicle up as a fixer-upper and experienced the new battery I purchased dying pretty quickly (cheap battery).  As a part of the battery rehab I replaced the cheap old lead bolt on terminals with copper lugs and brass terminals, negative& positive post protectors, and a battery hold down.  Now I can be confident this area of the under the hood will be trouble free for awhile!<br /><br />I originally planned on using this when I pulled the old battery to replace it and do all of the above described maintenance.  Unfortunately, the old battery died before I could use it and I lost the memory on my radio.  The day after I replaced the battery I used it to see if it would work when I did all of the planned battery maintenance and it worked!"
positive,I *wish* I had more leather products to use this on!  The leather cleaner comes with a microfiber towel to use for cleaning and the bottle is an easy to use spray bottle.  It's a giant bottle and should last you a long time.  After testing this on a purse I decided my next use is my car seats!  It was easy to use (easy to follow instructions) and I had good results!
positive,My husband has been using Rain-X Weatherbeater Wiper Blades since they were recommended by our mechanic who we've trusted for years. He likes them a lot and says they do a great job and last a long time. We buy them here on Amazon because we save a little and they're easy for him to put on himself.
positive,O ring and un-rusted fitting seems to seal the leak. Made well.
positive,"2003 Matrix easy. NO-TOOL INSTALLATION. Snap-fit hook arm design, this little happy homemaker 50 year old did it in under 5 minutes the first one took 4 minutes the 2nd, once I knew what I was doing, took a minute - lol!. These come with a REPLACEMENT INDICATOR. Alerts you to change your wipers as they are nearing the end of their life - takes the guess work out."
negative,Really useless. The pump comes on and starts to pump the liquid. It gets into the tube but cannot pump it to the end unless the tube exit is lower than the top of the pump. I have no idea how this good get any positive rating.
positive,good
positive,Fit right in
negative,several repeats of the same sizes.
positive,item as described
positive,"I have not ran it as of yet , the inverter box itself is nice , small but according to reviews ( why I selected this ) is like 1300 sales 4 1/2 stars !<br />GOD bless ,<br />Robert"
positive,Easy to install very convenient
positive,Exactly what we had hoped for.
positive,"Exactly what I expected. We cut this in half to have two smaller pieces, and use it to dry off skate blades, skis, snowboards, etc. The one I received is a nice heavy weight. I expected it to smell like a piece of leather, so it didn't bother me. After week or so there is no notable smell."
positive,"I bench tested the charger output across a range of programmable power supply conditions for advertised charge output functionality based on reviews. The charger inserts itself in a feedback loop between the battery and the charger's uP control. The uP firmware reacts with both amp and voltage output and adjusting to a firmware version of an optimized charge.<br /><br />To be clear, there is no solution for answering the most important question, ""How much longer will the battery last?"". It's a great opportunity for someone to patent a device where the battery physicists can't find an answer. As a physicist, my answer is consistently, ""Buy the next battery the same day this one goes out of warranty"". The warranty life is statistically based on the results of design life testing of large sample lots. For any specific battery ... buy a new one the very day it runs out of warranty.<br /><br />The system performs as advertised. The charger becomes a component in a closed-loop feedback cell when attached to the battery. That's a step function improvement over the old-school trickle charger.<br /><br />My use is deep cycle marine batteries. These are different from car batteries. A deep cycle marine battery encounters all sorts of more complex transient and parasitic situations. In the worst case and through a series of unfortunate events, you can dissolve your aluminum boat in the water, pit the prop or sacrifice the season's sacrificial plate overnight.<br /><br />Sophisticated, value for money charging system. Works great with marine batteries. It should work better on your car's battery. The best car battery solution is to buy a new battery on the day the warranty expires.<br /><br />Was my review helpful? If so, click ""Helpful"" so I can know."
positive,"The hitch was very high quality, paint is great, and the item was very easy to install. I installed it without help in approximately 20 minutes start to finish including clean-up.  I have used it a couple times and very easy to use. It is high quality and fits as specified."
positive,Awesome products and services
positive,Easy to install
negative,"Nice for the money, but does not fit tight or can be fitted in a VW GTI. I use it on the driver side, it does not fit, it has to be pulled every time I enter the car. It might fit well with other cars. The size is OK but it can not be fitted tight.  I get harassed every time my husband sits in my car. I just smile because what do I expect for the money."
negative,Doesn't even touch to stick. These got tossed after several attempts. Would not buy!
positive,This fits my 2016 Murano like a glove!  My husband bought this for me because my 2006 murano had a cargo liner from Nissan and I loved it.  While it wasn't &#34;pretty&#34; it was easy to clean and kept the back of my car clean.  This husky liner is still &#34;pretty&#34; and fits perfectly! I am so happy with it!
positive,"sounds great and was easy to install.  Well, the old exhaust was a pain to remove but this new system went in fine.  1996 tahoe 4d."
positive,Perfect for Camaro z28 1998. LS1 motor
positive,"Fits the automatic transmission on a 95 Geo Tracker 4x4 (hard top). Changing transmission fluid required removing the front drive shaft, but the filter and gasket were perfect match for OE."
positive,Great for on the road
positive,"Arrived ahead of schedule that's Great needed them mine where shot,  just as described fit and worked great Thanks"
positive,"I was previously using a flexible 45 degree coupling and had trouble hooking and unhooking my macerator pump. Since hooking up the new connector, I can swap from my grey water hose to the pump and back with no difficulty."
positive,Easy to install and firmed up my steering.  Affordable price for a good product.
positive,"I have an older car 26 years old to be exact. And the blades I had on there were only 3 years old. But this is Florida, and the heat will ravage  windshield blades.  I would purchase this product again. I recommend it."
negative,"Very difficult to work with, easily cracks while cutting it. Finished my loop, then during a stress test one of the tubes formed a small crack. Extremely inconvenient, now have to drain and re-do that part. I say avoid."
positive,Chevron has served me well for decades.  Buy oil only from oil companies with their own refineries and long history of making quality motor oil.  Chevron doesn't waste money on advertising and passes the savings to consumers.
positive,[[VIDEOID:398a5cadf2eacd9ba6fc28c74ac2acc5]] It was easy to install with a standard toolkit looks great and it locks. Bought this after someone tried to sabotage my truck. It's cheap insurance !
positive,Hasn't blown off in over a month. Holding color well in TX sun.
negative,Like the way it looks BUT VERY POOR RECEPTION ON EVEN LOCAL STAIONS. Bought a 12.00 antana from local auto shop and works GREAT.
positive,Fit my vehicle!!
positive,Part works perfectly. Thank you.
positive,A good fit but could have used a bit more double sided tape on the top but overall Seems nice.
positive,easy to use and works well but it does seem underpowered or perhaps I have unrealistic expectations
negative,TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE COLOR
positive,Bought these to put on my car while my daughter was learning how to drive. Very easy to<br />put on and take off. Good quality. Thanks!
negative,Use bungies to secure it. Came off during 1 ride at 45mph. Had to go back a mile to get my bag with wallet in it. Otherwise it’s a nice back.
negative,Didn't fit.  Sent it back.
positive,It works!
positive,Heavy duty and looks well on my truck.<br />2016 Silverado 2500<br />Many complements 😊
negative,"Originally, I had said that my husband loves these brakes, but after a few months they began squeaking pretty bad when the car comes to a slow stop. If you slam on the brakes it won't squeak, but who drives like that normally? We have had two mechanics look at them and they say the brakes are in great shape and have over 25,000 miles left on them. So we will deal with the squeaks but will never buy ceramic brake pads again."
positive,Great!
negative,"The truck carpet bed mat is awesome.  This tailgate mat matches, but a fraction of the thickness.  I feel it is worth $10 most.  Looks good and better than nothing on the knees, and cut the correct size, but that's it."
negative,"Obviously a returned unit was shipped to me. Box was beat up but radiator looked OK. Installed and it leaked. Took it back out and noticed it was stripped. They put a handy sticker on it saying stripping would void warranty. I've done many major jobs at my shop. No one stripped this and it was clearly returned stripped, stickered and sent back out. Too late to do anything so I eat the cost on this one. That's the bad of Amazon."
positive,"Installed on the serpentine belt tensioner of my 2005 Pontiac Grand AM 2.2L Ecotec.  A new tensioner was about $60. so just replacing this part was a cheap fix.  My old pulley had some deep grooves in it and I didn't want to reuse with the new serpentine belt. Getting the tensioner off is a bit difficult.  Installing the new pulley is easy, but the real trick is getting the tensioner back on in such a tight space and getting the bolt started.  Two people would make it easier, but I used grease to stick the tensioner to the engine while I got the bolt started."
positive,"great product, great result"
negative,Half if them didn't work. Other half are not bright AT ALL.
positive,Awesome product. Better than weather tech
positive,These KC HiLights are a great add on
positive,"I purchased these for my 2014 4runner SR5. I went with these because of the price point and I liked the look compared to the basic nerf bar style or like what N-fab sells. I don't drive over boulders so sliders were overkill and didn't do much to help my wife or daughter get into the vehicle. Shipping was quick. Product was very well packaged. Fit was spot on. Quality appears to be excellent but time will tell. These mount where the factory running boards would mount, not to the frame. The gap between the body and step is small, which I appreciate. If you're looking for an alternative to factory or n-fab, these are it."
positive,Just what I was looking for to cover up that paint chip on my back bumper!
positive,great fob. put cost 30dollars a piece to program as you have to have special tool to program. but only takes less than 2min. had 3fobs. surprise extra 90 dollars.
negative,It rusted pretty quickly but I guess that's expected. Otherwise did what it was suppose to.
positive,"WOW! Just WOW!<br /><br />Before purchasing these bulbs I was using AuxBeam which I had to constantly replace due to failure in my 2017 Subaru WRX. These Katana Bulbs, on the other hand, put out much more light and have an in-line power converter. I believe this is one of the main reasons for the bulbs stability and lack of flickering like some other brands. The convert seems to give the bulb a consistent 36 volts.<br /><br />Please, do not put these inside a housing meant for standard halogen bulbs. The light behaves differently and blinds oncoming traffic. This is illegal in most states.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Value, Great price for a quality product<br /> - Instant-on, no warm-up like HID<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Finding a place to mount the separate power convert requires more work, but it's worth it"
positive,I bought this fob for my Hyundai Sonata because the original was no longer working . I followed the directions and the new fob was set . For 60 dollars this was much cheaper than going to the dealer or locksmith. I would highly recommend this seller and product . Any negative reviews are probably due to ordering the wrong fob .
positive,As described. Fast delivery.
positive,Fast shipping!
positive,Good clutch assembly at an affordable price.
positive,This stuff is great.
positive,I have a harley electragilide ultra with no antennas. The xxl fits it nicely. I do not see a xl fitting this bike. It is heavy material and the zipper in the back is great for accessing. I would like to see some sort of color difference.  Finding the front is a pain when its cooking out of the saddle bag. Yes the zipper is there for the back but it's not easily seen. Let bike cool down a few minutes before you.cover it.
positive,Thank you!
negative,"I buy lots of stuff from Amazon.  I would rate these no stars if I had a choice.  They have an ok return policy, but if you happen to open an item and then find out it's not as advertised, then you won't get your total expense back.  I researched LED waterproof tail lights for my boat trailer for hours and then settled on this Wesbar kit.  It leaks more than Noah's boat.  Submersible anything, in salt water, that is not waterproof lasts for about two trailer dips in the sea.  $64 bucks for these and I could have gotten the 10 dollar ones with the 357 bulbs that last about the same time.  (No longer)Totally disappointed.  This product is expensive for what you get.<br /><br />I'm going to backtrack a little on this review.  Although I still think the light set is overpriced, because the electronics are sealed, the lights work as advertised, so far.  I've have them under water, without disconnecting about 10 times and they are still working fine.  Before I installed them, I sealed around all of the exposed edges and especially where the connection wires exit the shell.  In the Chesapeake, the saline content is between 20-30%.  I'll have a better indication of how they last when I'm in Florida where the saline content is around 60%. Soooo.  I'm going to give them 3.5 stars for now.  [[ASIN:B001VD5NPM Wesbar LED Submersible Trailer Light Kit - U80]]<br /><br />One last thing.  Lots of products listed on Amazon should have a better explanation to make it easier for the consumer to make a decision."
positive,"I bought this for my wifes car and it fits perfect. I have 3 noah car covers one for each of our cars, and they all are great I would recommend to anyone.  Especially in AZ they will help keep your paint from fading. Just remember to take them off before it rains."
negative,"This product is a quality product but the fitment guide is wrong. This WILL NOT fit my 2004 E55 AMG even though it says that it will. The correct part for that car is the Mann C 3689. The filter is physically too deep and will not allow the airbox to be closed. Again, check your OE part number."
positive,"This is a little small for an ATV.  It would be EXCELLENT for a motorcycle.  I was able to get this on my ATV, but it is stretched super tight.  The plastic hooks were never made to have so much tension on them.  THIS IS MY FAULT.  They would be perfect for a motorcycle."
positive,"If you use microfiber towels, mops, or other microfiber items this works great cleaning them.  Used to regular laundry detergent and this stuff works better"
positive,"Hold phone securely, have never had an issue to date"
positive,They look really classy on my Cadillac and are metal. Have tabs that snap on to cover screws. They look nice but wish they were metal. They pop off when I wash the car so I remove them and snap back on after done drying with micro cloth.
positive,Would buy again. Good sun protection.
positive,Wow was I thrilled to preserve my brand new car from my sweet dog!! He loves to dig in his nails right there on corners. Saved by the Center Cover!<br />Thanks!!
positive,Awesome Rotors - quick shipping - easy to install (look great!!)
positive,High quality.
positive,This product has held up great in Wisconsin winter. Recommend to anyone looking for a snow removal tool.
positive,Love these! I use them in all of our vehicles.
positive,"Not the right shape, but it fit in and worked fine. They were straight and the bulbs they replaced we at a 90 degree angle but it didn't make a difference for me."
positive,"One of these seized up within 100 miles.  I was able to free it up by stomping on the brakes a couple of times, and haven't had any issues since then. I originally posted a 1 star here, as I thought both of them were leaking! Pulled everything apart yesterday and discovered the leak is the dana 80 axle seals, not the calipers, so I have edited this review to correct. Again, other then the brief sticking issue, no problems with these at all."
positive,nice &#34;extra&#34;
positive,Bought for my dad.  Perfect purchase.
positive,"I wish I had a before and after picture.  This gem of a storage container helped to keep my trunk clean.  It holds A LOT for the price.  Plus the nifty velcro pads on the bottom are great to help keep it from rolling around.  It is REALLY secure back there.  Great price, quick ship, holds a lot."
positive,Worked great.
positive,Might as well go pull some from a junk yard after a week one failed and others feel like I have poor power. Thank God I saved a couple of my old ones
negative,Poor fit. Two of the four mounts broke on install.
positive,"Fit fine on my E70 X5 4.8i, but it doesn't latch.  Also it was blue.  Was thinking it was black, but the fluid is blue so I guess that's ok."
positive,Just installed this today oem at reasonable price
negative,Didn't match the Alpine white 300 very well.  It's a brighter white.
positive,"It's crazy that I can order up new parts for my 80 year tractor cum lawnmower but it makes these old tractors a stylish bargain. It turns out that I didn't need this fully built distributor (It was the coil) but this was a drop-in unit. I checked the points gap before installing & it was already correctly set. It is not an exact replacement. The casting is a little rough, the points & coil are a little different (but will still interchange) & the hardware is different. I think the aftermarket coils that are available here & at Tractor Supply fit this distributor better than the original."
negative,Returned
positive,Perfect for my Wives 03 Escape. Bought the rotors and pad here cheaper than I could buy just the rotors local
positive,Just as described!
positive,"I learned that some of my other tire gauges were off by as much as 5 psi and another one was low by 4 psi. So depending upon what I grab, I would end up having one tire having too much pressure and another tire with not enough on the same car. I threw all of those gauges out, which was most of them.<br />Get a certified one."
positive,Nice inexpensive blinkers
positive,"This contains everything you should need to rebuild an already complete Holley 1904 carburetor.  The quality of the parts in the kit is not as nice as the original Holley parts, but this is what we're stuck with present day to service 50+ year old things."
positive,There’s nothing better to add to the fuel you use for your lawn equipment. Counteracts the ethanol so your equipment runs smooth and without destroying the fuel lines or your carburetor. Just 1oz treats up to 5 gallons.
positive,"I purchased these to fill in the annoying gap between my front seats and center console so I would stop losing important tiny things in the void between my seats. They fit perfectly and are helped by the foam wedges that ship with them. I am able to fill in the dead space and turn it into a place for phones, MP3 players, and other small things that I want to have at hand while driving. The black leatherette looks really sharp with the red stitching and perfectly fits with my VW Beetle's black and red interior. I feel like these were a great value for the price."
negative,this is a very stiff seat but it does what its suppose to so all in all not terrible.
negative,"Not too impressed with this item. I know it's inexpensive, but I thought the scraper would at least be hard plastic. It's more of a hard rubber of sorts. It definitely would not hold up if you live in an area where there's really thick ice on your car in the mornings. I live in the high desert in AZ & we get frost & ice build up on our cars in the morning during the winter. It's just solid enough to hold up to that, but I wouldn't count on it working if we move back east....."
positive,Exactly what i needed. Would order from seller again
positive,Love mine but it’s hard to press the remote start button
negative,"Idk if you’re supposed to wash this prior to use.. but I just used it straight out of the package and dried the exterior of my car. My paint color is black, and has newly applied caramic coating. and at the time of drying the car it looked fine. Cut to the next morning, and I see my car covered in fine yellow dust!! You can wipe it off with your fingers, but it was sticking to the car pretty well. Like what the heck happened?? Def try buying something more expensive. Also these things are sooo thin.. like idk how they’re supposed to absorb any water. I bought 4 of them and I still could barely dry off my entire car. I’m not sure if I’m using them wrong or all these positive reviews are lying… but I’m def not buying these again"
positive,"Solid, they stay in place, look great, great coverage. Haven't taken them out to clean them yet but compared to the mats I had in my Jeep before I would hazard to guess these will be a breeze to clean with a nice scrubber. Invaluable purchase after doing a lot of dirty work with my boots. I also bought the back piece so I can throw tools and crap on the floor without getting dirt and sawdust ingrained in the carpet: also a perfect fit."
positive,"I love the size of the organizer it can be turned either way in your vehicle, I also love all the pockets on the outside for smaller items. The inside is really roomy and you can make a couple of different pockets, I have jumper cables, emergency blanket, LED Flares, first aid kit etc, and still have room. Also if I take the SUV on a trip instead of the car I can easily pick it up by the sturdy handles and put it in the SUV. Totally Organized now."
negative,"I couldn't wait for this helmet to get here & it looks just as ridiculous as I hoped, like a great big ball cap with a weird bill. Unfortunately the XL is way too small for my XL head. It probably has the correct volume but, unlike a human head, it is almost round. If it was long enough it wouldn't fit well on the sides.<br />The plastic shell is molded in one piece & it is thick. There are a couple of spots where the finish isn't smooth but it is mostly shiny & looks nice overall. I like the liner but the padding is very thin. The straps are very lightweight & the left side didn't go around my ear where it makes a triangle.<br />I was only intending to wear this for low-speed riding like around the neighborhood & at events where helmets are required but speed is just cruising. The ""bill"" has a steep curve on the front, probably to keep it from catching in the event of a crash. Helmets with visors are multi-piece so the visor can break away from the helmet."
positive,Excelente
positive,Love these covers. had to buy a pair for the wife's car too!!
positive,"These 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Front HOOD Shocks are great. I have a 2004 Jeep Cherokee Laredo, these simply snapped into place, installation took just seconds! The hardest part was waiting for them to arrive! Now lets see how long they last.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00Z2CXC24 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Front HOOD Shocks / Supports / Gas Springs (Pack of 2 / Pair / 2pc)]]"
positive,Honestly he just put them on today so I haven't had a chance to see how they do.  But they look great.  I can give a better report after I've had a chance to try them during a rain.
negative,Gets in tight areas just feels awkward until you use it a few time. Does not seem like it would be good for lots of cleaning but for cars it works fine
negative,"I’m sure they are great. For some other car.<br />Was supposed to be for my Nissan Xterra. When they came in they didn’t fit, not even close.<br />Now I have two brand new useless filters, I hate to<br />throw them away."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:9bd4e9865c693399e30bd011027f4c00]] Bought these after going to a shop who said 200$ for a bulb replacement. It took 10mins to install, these are MUCH brighter than my factory stock lights, i can see CLEARLY and everything is bright as day now!"
positive,its ok
positive,Great fit! Seems to be a better than average quality. Time will tell.
positive,"This fit perfectly on 2002 Jeep grand Cherokee.  Easy to install and saved huge $ by doing it myself. They may seem too big, too square, and too chunky when you first look at/try to install them, but they do compress down when you tighten the retainer bolts."
positive,"So I wanted to get a fresher look for my 02 Silverado 2500HD Duramax which frankly is about half life on its engine and looks like new.  So I noticed the newer duramax have these nice raised emblems that look great.  So I purchased them.  It came with a install system that is genius.  Basically they have a scaffold around the entire lettering with sticky plastic on both sides.  What you do is pull the plastic off the back side while the scaffold keeps all of the letters in perfect order until you stick it to your truck.  Once stuck in place, you remove the sticky plastic on the lettering side and lift the scaffold off the letters and FINISHED.  Perfect row of letters equal distance from each other.  No guessing and messing up the distance between and height of the letters in a row."
positive,"I had an old Dayton vacuum pump that I got from my dad and the coupler failed on it and I struggle to find a replacement especially for a fair price.  This kit not only has a coupler but replacement rubber feet which mine were also shot a new drain valve, sight window, etc.  Couldn't be happier."
positive,Lovevit
negative,"This product is okay, but too small in my opinion.  It is great for a &#34;grip&#34; on the pad which keeps you from getting cramps in your fingers, but would be much better if the base was larger to improve pad contact on the car/truck surface."
negative,A little smaller than I thought
positive,Worked perfect for vehicle.<br />Thanks .
negative,"Looks nothing like it was pictured on Amazon. Very very small, hard to read, bought two of them for $5.95 each, not worth the price."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:52eeb4af8c4729aaf185db19a8ae9ec1]] I actually bought this for my car, but I ended up using it for so much more.  It's a lot stronger than I expected.  The suction is great and it's not really that loud compared to a regular vacuum.  It's great for cleaning my car floorboards and the seats.  I also use it in my grow room quite a bit.  It's really good at sucking up spilled potting soil.  Since it's small and hand held,  I can use it on the floor, but also on my potting table,  the shelves in the greenhouse, and to clean the dust from my grow lights."
positive,How to take out that last little bit of wiggle
positive,"It’s ever so slightly smaller than I would have liked, but works well for its intended purpose. The magnets could stand to be a bit stronger and I would have liked to have seen a magnet on the bottom for keeping it in place on the jack but I can’t fault the operation. It cupped the pinch welds on my miata like...well, it cupped them just fine and kept them happy during the jacking."
positive,"Big upgrade for my 2010 RX350 DRL and high beam combo. Was not sure if needed extra resistor because of same bulb two functions, but after contacting the top notch customer service team, promptly they answered my issue and recommended a resistor for this application. Worked great ! I have purchased several Sealight products and from recommendation my friends have too and are all very satisfied.<br />Thanks again!"
positive,"After trying this in my wife rav4 I'm switching everything to this oil. I use Mobil 1 advanced  synthetic in everything now except my wife's car. My truck, tractor, lawnmower, weedeaters 4cycle is going to Pennzoil.  Pouring it in to the car you see that it's a very light golden color compare to Mobil 1, Mobil 1 has been good to my vehicles but Pennzoil is better from the tests I've seen and it's cheaper than Mobil 1, try it you'll make the change to !"
negative,"Description says it comes with level sensor, but it doesn’t. Highly disappointed. False advertising."
positive,Fit a 05 Sebring 2.7
positive,"I bought this to jump start my car if my battery went dead at work & no one was around with jumper cables.<br />It's kinda bulky / not integrated, but seem like it will be good long term. There is no battery to keep charged or go bad.  I purchased a 10A 12v DC power supply to fully charge it up in 2 minutes for about$15.  A couple times it worked fine and once not so well, I think it was the safety stuff and the convoluted way of disabling it.  To turn off / ignore all the safety stuff and enable output this is the basic info.<br /><br />If charging, the voltage led should be blinking red-yellow-green when fully charged the voltage display on the capacitor bank will read around 14v as well.<br /><br />To turn on override hold then release the on/off/override button, when it blinks green, quickly press start or it will time out,  the relay will click and this is when 12V @ 300A on the output clamps is enabled.<br /><br />(You can also charge it from the/a battery but results will vary )"
positive,excellent service and fast item
positive,I picked up this one for my son whose car is not staring reliably. I have a similar model that has served well and this one was close in design. It has started his car multiple times and he has gotten it down to about a 3 min process. Fantastic product for the price. All car owners should have something like this in your vehicle.
positive,"Very high quality, professional looking and works perfectly!"
positive,Now the old car has some protection.
positive,Easy to install
positive,"Its a Gates Water Pump, they usually have little issues"
positive,Very cute but smell was really non-existent.<br />Looks good hanging in my truck!
positive,Really can't beat this simple device for topping off coolant in my car. It's super simple to use and makes filling up the radiator with the correct amount a breeze.  Plus it makes it very easy to put back any excess coolant back into the jug.  No spills. No mess. Love it.
positive,Fit my 08 Ram 1500 perfectly.  Had them on for months now and very happy so far.
positive,"I like that they are brand new and that the 2 emblems I received came earlier than I expected, Thank you so much. They look great on my Chevy Impala."
positive,works as it should
positive,"Product was very easy to install. Direct fit. Left them black instead of painting them, as they actually look better this way on the car."
negative,Neoprene makes it hot. Not a good fit
positive,Made install of O2 senor a snap.
positive,This was installed in a 2004 rx330. It perfectly matches the factory appearance and is much cheaper. Only issue is that the socket doesn't lock into the light very well. Might need to silicone it in place.
positive,"For years, I had my car papers sitting in whatever the dealer gave me (maybe an envelople) and whenever the unfortunate situation of getting pulled over had happened, I was always a panicked mess trying to find everything.<br /><br />I moved everything over into this great organizer and now I feel like my glovebox chaos is solved. Highly recommend to any car owner as it is nice to actually have a good setup for a change."
positive,"I'm 5'8"" 150 lbs..  A Medium fits perfect over my Textile Motorcycle Jacket.  Doesn't flap around at Freeway speeds, and stays wind tight.  Rain?  So far I've only used during heavy drizzle.. But my guess is it will keep you warm n dry..."
positive,FITS
positive,"They feel well built, even just one has a little weight to it. I wasn't afraid to push these things into a tight slot with a bit of force. Light output is phenomenal, very white and very bright. Had them on for about 2 hours now and still cool to the touch. No weird buzz or high pitch noise either."
positive,Ergonomic shape fits the knee very well. Compared to some of the other knee pads that I bought these ones have good padding and even protect the sides of the knee. Extra point for ability to remove or wear with shoes on! (I remove it for long sustained climbs). Only complaint is that these get super hot on warm days (ventilation is not great)
positive,very good
negative,I was really looking forward to being able to lock my gas cap on my SUV with a huge gas tank.  Got the cap and put it on the SUV and headed to the gas station.  Arrived at gas station put the key in and found out that it didn't work.  Not liking the idea of pushing the SUV home I borrowed a screw drive and easily pried the cap off (so much for security). It must have just been this cap as this is the second one that I purchased from Amazon and the first one has been working for 3 years.
positive,so far I have not used it
positive,"Like it. Works for what I needed Compact. Meant for detailing little nooks, crumbs on the floor, or upholstery which drive me crazy. Good for small lightweight jobs.  Obviously not designed for heavy cleaning. For those I use my shop vac. But sometimes it’s a pain to pull out the big shop vac just for a bit of maintenance cleaning. I like it. Works for me."
positive,Great for perking up leather.
negative,Sorry they didn't work for me.
positive,"First, they are certainly brighter than the factory.  I found that they only work on High beams - maybe I have in the wrong spot?  They are certainly bright, and install was pretty easy."
positive,One of the bolts stripped out but other than that these fit with my non-OEM roof rails and i'm very happy.
positive,Security screws are stainless
positive,"Great part, easy to install and accurately warns its time for a brake pad replacement."
negative,actually decreased the pressure of a gravity fed tank... must have been broken
positive,Works great
positive,Awesome OEM replacement. Highly recommend and would buy again.
positive,"Works flawlessly. Use it on my 997 Porsche, to keep battery in great shape when the car sits for more than a couple days. This model is IDENTICAL to the Porsche branded model, but costs much less. You will need to buy the cigarette lighter adapter separately, but you still come out way ahead."
negative,Nice and sparkly. Is a bit large
negative,Leak around the foam padded lenses when it rains. Had to keep emptying them out.
positive,"The hose is a bit short but adequate for most applications.  It does not seem to have a swivel head (unless it is so tight, I'm afraid to twist it).  It makes reading the gauge a bit awkward in close motorcycle quarters. It is however, very accurate and the gauge is easy to read. My model doesn't hold the pressure in memory.  The air pressure release while attached is a convenient feature if you have too much air pressure in the tire. I like the angle head for attaching it to a tire valve.  It fits your hand much better then most other brands to help you hold a positive seal on the valve. A much more natural gripping device for a persons' fingers. After using it awhile, I realize that the base where it connects to the tire valve swivels, not the head and hose.."
positive,Beautiful but it sheds a lot :(
positive,"While I find that the slices I usually need to make are 3/8-1/2"" ones, the same billet connector in this size is very well made."
positive,Nice size!
negative,No mounting hardware detracts from its potential
positive,This is okay for a trunk. I wouldn't buy the floor mat edition of this.<br /><br />Overall is ok.
negative,"Claims to help with noise and heat. Some improvement with noise, zero with heat. Using in a Ford, Transit. The floor and doors allow a lot of noise in and the floor gets very hot. I still couldn’t stand on the floor on an 80 degree day. I realize part of this is Fords problem, but this product did not help with heat."
positive,awesome product! I use it mixed with Mr pink in a foam cannon and man does it make taking off bug guts easy! only reason it's 4 stars because it took a month to gwt to me because of back order
positive,Perfect fit no issues with installation.  Works as advertised.
positive,Even though it said it wouldn’t fit Maserati levante it did fit and was easy to install for me a female. Closest color I could find to match my dark red interior. Feels comfortable and looks good great buy!
positive,"The hinges seem to squeak/quirk upon first opening after awhile.<br /><br />I suggest, per Fords lubrication guidelines, minimally using white lithium grease on the inside hinge prior to installing.  You don't want lubricant streaking all over the rear glass/wipers.<br /><br />Or, could be I installed the hinges slightly out of alignment, causing the initial squeak/quirk noise.  For now, my bets on lube."
positive,"I'd give it Five Stars, but I have only had it on one night.<br /><br />Put this in place of original harness/relay that came with an aftermarket (expensive) HID headlight set for a Ford F150.<br />The electronics on this HID aftermarket kitchen are so flaky, I've replaced the relay twice. If they get wet, they go bad, go figure.<br />Didn't the vendor anticipate this concept called RAIN ?!<br /><br />Well he wants to sell me a $30 relay and can ship it next week.<br />Can't wait that long.<br /><br />Instead I get this H13 OEM harness/relay from AMZN, 2 Day Prime.<br />Installed, worked perfectly. Duh.<br />This is for a 55W BiXenon HID pair.<br />Just plugged it into the ballasts from the other kit, power, ground, and connected the Hi Beam connector and voila, it works.<br />This kit controls the high beams for a BiXenon that uses the shutter to lift up and let the 'Hi Beam' out.<br />So we'll see what happens over time, and maybe I'll give it the other star.<br /><br />BTW, I tried to plug in the relay from this Kensum kit into the harness in the truck from the original harness that came with the headlights and things did not work. I am impressed that something didn't blow up. But just because my relay and the Kensun relay both have the same connector, does not mean they are electrically identical. They were not."
negative,Did NOT come with light bulbs
positive,"I am VERY satisfied with this plate frame.  First and foremost, it's well done and looks great.  Second, and just as important to me, it came in quickly.  And when I say quickly I mean almost a week before the earliest of the estimated arrival dates.<br /><br />This plate frame looks head and shoulders better than [[ASIN:B01G9LCI76 GP Personalized Custom License Plate Tag Frame with Steel Metal Plain Text Chrome Free Engraved]] I ordered from a different dealer.  (That one's rusting after 2 months of use.)  Hopefully this frame will provide much better lifespan than that other.  (I'm only putting the link so readers can see my review for poor product.)<br /><br />As frame plates go, this hits the spot!"
positive,Great
positive,"Happy with this cute bin! It's great for trash, but I'll be using it for snacks on the road since I drive for work and need food within reach when I'm busy. I'd suggest lining them with a small bag if you use it for trash and do be aware that while waterproof, you wouldn't wanna fill it with liquids garbage. Can be rolled up and butting for easy storage and takes up little space. It does not have a flap to close it, it is an open bin."
positive,"As noted in a few other reviews, there is a hole at the top of this funnel. It could create a problem as you pour liquid, but I found it easy to place my finger on the hole (on the outside of the funnel), as I held it in place during use. Problem solved. With that said, this little funnel worked great!"
positive,Fácil de usar y práctico
negative,I returned this item. The ball joint is not even a Moog.
positive,Very easy to install if you need to replace one of these for your sprinkler system.
positive,It is just right for a camping situation.  Cleanup was very easy. It is lightweight and stores easily.  Very happy that we purchased it.  Great bargain/value for the price.
positive,"Easy installation, programming is a little tricky. I installed this unit after giving up on another brand where you put an extra key in it. Wiring is a breeze if you know what you're doing and you shouldn't be installing a remote start yourself if you don't. 😀 Programming for my Ford Focus required reading some forums but works perfectly once programed.<br />One issue I've run into is having to reprogram it after the battery was disconnected."
positive,As advertised.
positive,As described
negative,"Strike TWO! this belt was too small for my 1997 Camry CE. I attempoted install after the return close date, so another donation to an Amazon partner due to faulty vehicle parts match app. on this site."
positive,"I bought 2 of these fans because my AC in my SUV unexpectedly quit during one of the hottest weeks of the year so far. It was going to take a while for my mechanic to obtain parts and do the repair on my SUV. I was ecstatic to find this fan here with the oscillating feature, at an awesome price. My prime benefits made this deal even better. Yes, its just a bit noisy, but not a rattling type noise, and not anything that I would find super annoying. I'd take a little noise (that can easily be muffled by the sounds of loud teenagers or the radio) over being miserable in the sweltering heat anytime. I had things to do and places to go and this fan was very effective in keeping us cool and circulating the air. I would highly recommend this."
negative,"This was a good, inexpensive hose for the first 2 weeks. After that it started to get stiff.  After a 2 week RV camping trip from NY to Florida, it’s now so stiff it will stand up by itself. Hose is worthless.  I missed the Amazon Prime return date by 9 days because I was on vacation."
positive,The part arrived ontime and it was the correct
negative,I used it on a motorcycle windshield. It did not remove scratches very well. I used it on a microwave front panel and the results were similar. Better than it was but not great.
positive,giid
positive,"It is thick enough, big enough, and very colorful!  I love it."
positive,"Good quality, fast shipping and great price!"
positive,Very good quality..
positive,The product was simple and easy to use. It came in a timely manner and I'm extremely satisfied with it and the service.
positive,No lint
positive,"Bought two of these, one for my Renegade and one for my husband's truck.  So far they are working out great!  It is easy to open the bag with just one hand and then snap it back shut.  Looks to be well made."
positive,It came packaged well and it looks new. Glad I got it because it saved almost 200 from the dealership.
positive,"I got these for my wife's car. Perfect fit, easy to install. Works on a 2006 Chevy Impala"
positive,Fixed the problem slightly. My 05 Trailblazer wasn't shooting any water. Replaced the pump and it did nothing. Replaced this and now I get a little flow. There must be a kink in the system somewhere.
positive,Very good. Even better if they offered larger size.
positive,well made at a good price
positive,"This is easy enough to install.  There is a recommended weight limit, and I would suggest adhering to it.  Because, at least for my 2017 S, this attaches to what seems to the the plastic infrastructure behind the headliner, and not the aluminum frame.  So if you pull the hook, you will see how the whole headliner moves with it, so be careful with these."
negative,"Had so much potential but fell short. Opens and closes easily. But after the THIRD use, two of the spokes poked out of the material scratching my windshield grrrrrrrr closing it back up after it happened, another broke through. Sending it back."
negative,This really didn’t do anything and didn’t improve the appearance of the leather. Seems pointless. I really wanted it to work!
positive,It showed me the leak I've been trying to find.
negative,"It worked as it was supposed to do, except the white lights came up to full brightness gradually.  Looked unnatural. I'm using a flasher for LED sights, and the amber lights work perfect, and when they shut down, the white light come on, but not instantly.  They start dim, and get to full brightness in 3 to 4 seconds."
positive,"No complaints about this battery that I installed on my 2015 Yamaha XT250. The bike starts in a pinch, and the size fits perfectly, no adaptation necessary. It comes with some hardware to connect to the battery cables, but I just used what I already had."
negative,"The instructions aren’t clear on how to use this item. Looks nothing like the picture. Don’t waste your money,"
positive,"I used this set on a 2006 Honda Pilot 2wd.  I had no problem installing the seals that I needed from the set.  I used the crank seal and the oil filter housing seal. No problems with installation. I installed the set about 2 months ago.  Crank seals are notoriously hard to install and have last for years.  If this seal leaks in a year, it'll be difficult to tell if it was my installation or the quality of the seals.  The original honda seal lasted almost 200k miles.  I doubt this seal will last that long so I'm hoping for 2-4 years from these seals.  If I get more than that, great."
positive,"Easy change out (3 screws and a plug). It runs smooth and quiet. Lowest price, too."
positive,I wanted some black badges to match the black Callaway lettering on my SC757 and these worked out perfect.  They are well made and the details of the flag are all retained.  Much better than using an overlay.
positive,Just what the car calls for
positive,Great product...
negative,This product is very cheap. You can see through it and the sun shines right through as well.
positive,"Perfect fit, should be. These are really OEM."
positive,I love these
positive,Must have. This thing has already saved me 8 hours of work and payed for itself on the first use. even my coworker was surprised.
positive,Replaced worn winch rope with this strap. Easy fix. Very strong and will last for a long time. My boat weighs 1900 pounds and I have found that it handles the weight just fine. Will be purchasing 2 more for pontoon boat and another boat.
positive,"It seems like it will protect the paint, just not easy to install."
positive,"Good quality transmission filter (but the seal is thin and not great). I ordered this cheaply enough that it was not a big deal. I was supposed to reuse the OEM, but instead ordered a new OEM. The OEM is much thicker and glass filled, this is very thin and tears easily/does not create the best seal."
positive,I bought this clothing bar for my husband‘s pick up truck. He absolutely loves it. Says it’s the best one he’s ever had.
negative,"The color is not the pretty teal depicted in the picture. It's just blue. The seller should update the pictures. Disappointing that I paid extra for my favorite color, yet it was not true to color."
positive,Perfect fit for my HD installed tender. Plugged a cord and my phone up and works great. Now the wife can have a fully charged phone while riding. More pictures!
positive,"the installation was super easy but the fit was horrible, the phone kept rattling all the time.  Broke the hinge trying to take it out. comes with a wooden phone stand, that was more value for money that the actual product.<br /><br />Update: great customer service.  the seller reached out to me to apologize and offered a full refund."
positive,"Put these on ‘00 excursion diesel 4x4.  These are for the 4x2 version for 2003 and newer.  They fit fine without any modifying. Before this, input on Energy bump stops.  They were absolutely harsh!  The Dorman rubber ones are much smoother.  Th"
positive,Ordered these shackles to lower the rear end of my 1999 Chevy Suburban K1500 approximately 2&#34;  after looking through Belltech's application guide on their website.  Looks great in gloss black and installed easily.  I suggest to anyone to look through Belltechs application guide if you're unsure of this part numbers application and what it will do for your specific ride.  This part will fit multiple vehicles but will have different results depending on application.
positive,"This locking, trailer hitch pin looks like it should last for a long time.  The locking mechanism feels solid and easy to operate.  I like that a flexible rubber cap is provides to keep dirt out of the lock cylinder.  The fit and finish appears very good.  There's even an o-ring on the shaft which I'm speculating was provided to take up any end shaft play that might allow a rattle.  That's a nice touch.  It will take a few years to know whether moisture and rust will come into play over time but I have high hopes."
positive,Fit perfectly for our 2014 Ford F-150
negative,I do not think this is an original flowmaster. I received it and the welds llooked poorly done. The paint was scratched and chipping off you could see a lot of silver coming thru. You can see  the flowmaster writing on this but I am not sure that they would have shipped something that looks so poorly made. I am skeptical to put this on over the weekend because I do not want to end up buying another if this does not work.
positive,Great idea.
positive,guuud
negative,"CD,s fall out."
positive,good replacement filter
positive,"Here's something I learned the hard way when I changed a tire with an inner tube for the first time. If you don't inflate the tube a little before you spoon the tire over the rim with an iron, you will pinch and inevitably puncture the tube.<br /><br />I can't vouch for the longevity of this tube but it certainly does the job."
negative,"I bought this to go into my 2012 GMC Acadia SLT1. I was told it was a good fit, however, when I mechanic came to install it, I was informed there was absolutely no way this alternator would fit in my SUV. I had to send it back and had to pay my mechanic $60 for coming out.<br /><br />The good thing about it was Amazon issued a refund on the spot 🙂 instead of making me wait until the part was returned. That's the only reason I gave a 3 star🤨. Otherwise, this review would've been a negative 10 🥴😬 (if they'd allow such a score 😉)."
negative,This Was Bought for a 1996 Chevy K3500 With 454 7.4. This is a Mutha  To Install ! 2 hour Job Min . Well I'm Not Buying another One From Amazon . Or at least this one ! Goin Down the Road And Just Shut Down . Lucky We Just left the Big City and Were 1/4 Mile From home . I had To Walk down and get Lawn Mower to Get it Back home ! I guess you could say It's my Lucky Day it Didn't happen in the Big City !
positive,"So far so good, seems to be of good quality."
positive,Why don't car manufacturers make better rear view mirrors? No more blind spots. Holding strong after 8 moths.
positive,Perfect replacement for my 02 Denali.  Easy install great price.
negative,"I made my whole car to be covered in purple which all worked out great except for these. Sadly the gems were already missing when they arrived in the mail! They also did not fit in my truck, but they did fit in my car. No idea why they didn’t fit both."
positive,"Easy to put on and looks so cute.  My windows are tinted, but you can still see it.  I would recommend."
positive,Nice. Easy to put on. Colors are good but should be brighter or even neon so you can see them better.
positive,Just what I needed for clearance lights
positive,"The product I received fits my Nissan Rogue Sport exactly as the video shows. It took a couple of minutes to install and is going to be great for storing my purse and other small things, and for helping block the dog from jumping in the front seat. It seems sturdy and well made."
negative,Gasket was missing a hole for bolt.
positive,Still in the testing phase but this is perfect
positive,"Decal actually measures 5.875 by 2.5, which is a little smaller than advertised. Looks to be of good quality though."
positive,"Great product; does what it was designed to do, which was to allow addition of large cables."
negative,"The bag looks good, but it doesn’t fit on all motorcycle, I have a original rack and backrest on my Harley Davidson and I’m not able to fix it correctly on my backrest. the fasteners are too small."
negative,The description said that  it would fit my car and the model year.  However it did not because the pins in the socket didn't match up..<br />Returning item.  No I am getting charged a restocking fee of 20% and I have to pay for return postage.  So I not very happy.
negative,"I’m disappointed, it only came with one.<br /><br />It needs to specify that you need to buy them twice to be legal..."
positive,AMAZING.
positive,Ingalls Engineering makes the best camber adjustment bolts in the market. Can't go wrong with these.<br /><br />Strong and plated against corrosion. Need an alignment after you install them.
positive,Awesome tire would recommend
positive,So worth the money
positive,Great product
positive,good quality. timely delivery. good price=A
positive,Awesome travel bag. We took it on a 6 hour drive through heavy rains and everything was bone dry when we arrived.
positive,Would order again. Would like to see page one of the instuctions updated and reprinted.
positive,Design great
positive,Great manufacturers product from awesome seller.  Corrected issue quickky and all is well. My ranger 570 is back on the trail!
positive,Fit perfect and was a great price
positive,"These grips are comfortable. Big, cushy comfort nd they look great. They went on my Intruder 1400 like they were meant to be there and the throttle boss does fit."
positive,I've only used it twice for 2 bicycles and it worked well.
positive,This fit perfectly on our 1977 F-250.
positive,"After my factory floor mats weren't doing the job I decided to get some aftermarket mats. I did some research and the results were Weathertech or Husky. After reading some reviews on a Subaru forum I decided to buy the Huskys. The fit is great, there are only a couple of areas were the mat doesn't hit the carpet snugly. The gas cap release is covered, but I can either lift the edge of the mat up or cut that section (it's marked) open. The underside of these mats, unlike some, have a lot of sharp nibs to help keep the mat in place. After using them over the course of these week, where we had snow and rain, it's amazing what they're keeping from being ground into the carpet of my car - sand, road salt, snow, mud. They look great and are a breeze to clean up - just wipe with a wet rag (don't use armor all or any of that stuff on these!)."
positive,Everything! It replaced old batteries in my motorized scooter.
positive,Clips and wire connections could be a bit stouter but for the price this is about the best going. They should last a life time if not abused.
positive,Easy to install and does the job
positive,We bought this to upgrade on a honda crf50. It fits great. The ability to adjust is awesome. Well worth the money.
positive,"Did exactly what you would expect.  The fit was perfect, and the van seems to stop way better that before.  After another 10k miles, still feels better than the factory pads that I replaced."
positive,The clip could be a little longer.  Keeps falling off the vent.
positive,This is if you have a dodge with amp underneath. Mine has thr infinity with two connectors. The harness fits perfect. The color code is off but thats ok you can look at harness and add things up.
positive,We love this thing. Our 2018 Pilot's center storage console is now nicely organized and I'm only wishing they'd make a stand/shelf that installs over the console that's sturdy enough to hold my wife's heavy purse so that I can easily slide open the center storage console to access the nicely organized interior.
positive,"Installed this grill on my 2015 Yukon Denali. the quality of the grill looks ok, it does change the look of the car. I  am ok with it."
positive,Charged two car batteries without issue.
positive,"A waterless wash will always be in my car detail toolbox and the Meguiar’s Ultimate Waterless Wash works great to touch up my vehicle and as a bonus it smells great.<br /><br />In use: I washed my vehicle at the coin wash and didn’t have time to dry it there, I drove about 5 miles away to my destination where I could finish and noticed some lightly dried water spots and road dust.  I grabbed a microfiber cloth and the Meguiar’s waterless wash and proceeded to wipe the entire vehicle down before applying a spray wax.<br /><br />I attached a pic, of course the waterless wash didn’t provide the mirror shine but I wouldn’t have been able to complete my detail job without it."
positive,Fit just like the stock OEM model! Runs great
positive,"I’m very pleased with my purchase, The filter fresheners keep my house amazing I normally change the fresheners 1 month."
negative,Nice price.  Nice ride on highway.  Not so great over speed bumps.  I have 5 in my neighborhood.
positive,"These things are so bright. Possibly too bright, but I love them. I've recommended them to a few people who also loved them. Very easy to install, makes everything in your car visible when its dark out."
negative,Had this starter for less than 2 years and only taken out around 4 times with starts in between.  Motor is completely rusted out.  There is no way this is a marine grade starter.  I usually like Sierra parts but the starter is obviously rebranded as marine but is not an actual marine starter.  Yes I know marine grade has to do more with no sparks in the engine compartment but it is also supposed to be sealed and this motor is not sealed.  When it worked it worked well.  But two years is unacceptable for a $200.00+ starter that is supposed to be sealed against corrosion like this.
positive,"I misread the description of this lamp, I thought it was going to be a single line bulb, but this one has 3 different segments that draw the line, it’s hard to explain, but when we mounted it to the forklift and calibrated it so that as the forklift is about to drive up to a row of shelves this light is drawing out its path in front of it.  With this light I dont think there is a way that you could run into the forklift unless your eyes were closed.  We are getting another one of these bulbs for the other side of the forklift to really protect everyone."
positive,This bag holds a decent amount and fits well under the rear passenger seat in our Wrangler JL.  It will not fit under the drivers side.  Still looking for a bag to fit that.  Seems well made and includes a removable shoulder strap.  I’d buy a second one if I thought it would fit.
positive,Worked well.  No issues.  Seems to have restored my fuel economy.
negative,"The suction cups are worthless. They arrived bent and impossible to stick to windows. The bands that snap around the headrests come apart easily, and the section by the lift gate scoots up easily. I suggest only buying this if you’re using a crate in conjunction."
positive,"My original headlights had gotten so dull it was hard to find out whether my lights were on or off at night. Last night I drove off with this new set of headlights installed, the moment I turned them on I was impressed by the brightness. Bulbs are included! No more double checking whether my headlights are on or off. Great quality, super fast shipping, great fit. Awesome looks."
positive,"This is a great 100% Genuine Toyota truck bed mat. I just bought a new 2017 Toyota Tacoma and this is the first thing I bought to keep my truck bed in a top shape. This mat does make my truck bed looking good. In addition to its aesthetic appearance, it also protects my truck bed from any scratches or dings. It definitely helps my Taco maintain its awesome value. For those who just bought a new Taco, this is a definitely a great investment."
positive,"I enjoy doing easy fixes like this to my vehicle because having a mechanic do it would cost about an hours worth of labor and they'd charge 3-4x the price I'm getting it for here.  So you can spend $26 and install it yourself (which is very easy), or spend around $150 to have a mechanic do it."
positive,"This starter fit perfect on my 2007 Honda odyssey touring.<br /><br />It came fast and looked even better then the oem.<br /><br />I cant comment on how long it has or will last as I just installed it today, but it worked perfect with no problems.<br /><br />There was no forcing or tinkering to get it to fit like some aftermarket parts... This was a straight bolt on and was fully installed and finished in 2 hours.<br /><br />Update 5/2020<br />It just started to go out, so I just replaced it. Literally lasted 6 years and nearly 100k miles this really is a great after market starter definitely recommend!"
positive,Great winch rubber stopper
positive,"Based on how I would normally use this, I wouldn't keep it attached to the hose when washing the car.  The brush is excellent for both scrubbing the car clean with liquid soap and then spraying water on the car and scrubbing the car again with this brush to get all the grime off.  I also live in a mobile home in an area where dirt cakes just about everything regularly so cleaning the sides of my home keep it looking better (considering it's older).  Being able to add all the pole sections to this brush will allow me to scrub the sides of my house without having to get up on a ladder.  Nice brush - just not great to be hooked up to a garden hose in my own opinion - but as a brush, it cleans wonderfully."
positive,"I carry one in each pocket in each door of the car, and instantly pull it to wipe off the dash, or the seat back, as well as the seat when necessary.  I wish they were a smaller size, and I have 'broken' some into smaller sizes with my serger.  (Quite a handful as they are)...I intend to use them in other places as well, as with my tile and wood floors.  I like the color...can't see how much 'ick' I've had around me :o)"
positive,"Perfect fit, super easy install for a total newbie (and saved hundreds from the dealership!!) Watch the YouTube,  and get the 2 bolts you need to screw in to back off the old rotors. Brake cleaner, all that stuff - easy!"
positive,"Love the Hawaiian print.  The fit was super snug and the sewing craftsmanship on both was not up to the necessary tugging, resulting in rips. Husband is using it anyway. Hope they last."
positive,I love it!!
negative,The wheel cover fits perfectly.  However the seat cover fits small on the toyota rave 4.  The material is flimsy and thin.  I have no idea how long the cover will last or the printing will last over time.  I would recommend paying a little extra on a cover that has a stronger and thicker material.
positive,"I like the material and it’s thick enough to protect my car key. Only thing I dislike is when you take it out your pocket, the little white fuzzy stuck on the rubber. I’m sure when you wash it with water it’ll easily come off."
negative,"Feels thick and sturdy, but came rusty in the inside? Hoping it holds up over time without breaking in the middle from the rust."
positive,Great purchase!  Works wonderfully!
positive,Bought these for my 16 year old he loves them..
positive,"Dealer wanted $65 for this filter installed.  Installation takes about 30 seconds.  Despite looking superficially clean, my filter was definitely overdue for a change: this replacement got me an extra 4mpg."
positive,"[[VIDEOID:56cc351e2e14eb6052af9ad481d7be6]] All the advantages of an electric orbital polished without the clumsy extension cords. You can use it anywhere, in the driveway, at the car wash, etc. It's powerful enough to get the job done. Comes with battery and charger, along with 2 bonnets. Part of the extensive Greenworks 24 volt system of tools. Recommended."
negative,"Had mixed results with these. I applied them to our windows per the directions. We had a 12 hour road trip planned. One of them stuck for the entire trip and will still stick. The other one dropped off after about 8 hours of driving. I couldn't find anything wrong with it per-se. The window was clean and the cling was clean, but it just wouldn't stick."
positive,Works in my lawnmower.
positive,just like the oem
negative,It's a pain to put in and adjust for each cup/bottle size without removing it from the cup holder.
positive,"This is the second brand of these I've tried for my 2023 Kia Ev6 Wind.<br /><br />Old set:<br />They just didn't quite fit. Maybe they fit 2022 better?<br /><br />With the old set, besides the fit, I had two big concerns. First, they were a little too stiff and plasticy. I was hoping for something a little softer and more rubbery. Second, the driver's side mat had a flap on the right side that wouldn't lay flat and kept interfering with my pedal foot. Yes I could have trimmed that piece and made do, but I decided to try this set instead.<br /><br />This set:<br /><br />They fit perfectly, popped right in, they are softer, and don't get in the way of my foot. You can see in the pix that they're a little pressed in on the sides from being boxed the way they were, but they've relaxed since then and fit snug all around. Also, sorry the driver's side picture is a little dirty but I live in Denver and it's January...<br /><br />If anything changes, I will update my review but so far I'm loving them."
negative,"Pros: battery driven; flashing or steady light; flameless flare; can be used as a map light; reusable. Could be used effectively as a light that does not seriously degrade night vision.<br /><br />Cons: Product claims to be visible at 1000 ft, but this is only possible within a few degrees of view. One half of the top lights up for a dim presentation, but the bright LED shines out through a narrow beam like a small red flashlight. Consequently, the flare would probably not be useful in a traffic situation since it would have to be precisely aligned with oncoming traffic and would only be visible by the few drivers within this narrow beam of light. It is certainly not a good substitute for a real flare which is much brighter and omnidirectional. This little light is not as good as the emergency flashers built into vehicles.<br /><br />If you want a safety flare to carry in your vehicle, buy the real thing. If you want a light you can use as a map light without distracting a driver, or to see where you're walking without seriously degrading your night vision, this red light will do that well."
positive,"Why pay 3 times as much for the same thing at the local auto parts store?  It's an air filter not a pacemaker, for crying out loud."
positive,Well made and looks good instructions leave a bit to be desired but still informative.<br /><br />Mat black finish is well applied and the hardware looks like it has a quality finish.<br /><br />The rubber bump tabs that back stop the door are a little disappointing in size and could be beefier the locking tab could be a bit tighter the tab needs a minor adjustment maybe 1/24th closer.<br /><br />All in all the item is still a good value and a steal at the pricing of  one third the cost of similar Fuel tank Doors.
positive,Absolutely love this! It looks even better than the photo and it is going to make the perfect christmas gift! So happy i bought this
positive,"I love this steering wheel cover, very smooth and love the design"
positive,Perfect fit on my 2017 Yama 200
positive,"used this in my cup holder on recliner. great to hold remotes, snacks, or phone."
positive,"I have had these on my xterra for about 5000 miles.  No issues.  The ride improved (not as bouncy) but there definitely not too stiff.  I guess time will tell, but seem OK from here."
positive,"for my neighbor, he is very happy"
negative,"Works fine. Build quality could be better. But for the price, it is fine."
positive,Use 2 to dry a hatchback. Much more absorbent than cheaper towels. Tags tear out easily enough. Makes cleaning easier.
positive,"Good stuff, I use it on my old rifle's iron sights and it's worked pretty well so far.  Definitely recomend."
positive,Keeps truck/car insurance data handy and out of glovebox..
negative,"The only problem I encountered was getting the embedded bolts to fit into the fender mount holes, they were bent out of the correct position.  This probably happened in shipping because the parts were packaged in soft and flimsy cardboard and the boxes were trashed by the time they reached my house.<br />I had quite the time getting them to fit but once I did they performed perfectly!<br />Update 5-23-21:  7 months after I installed these struts they sound just the same as the 16 year old struts I replaced.  They rattle and fail on bumps, I am thoroughly dissatisfied with this, I almost lost part of my finger installing them in the first place because the top bolt pattern is a couple MM off.  Now I have to do it all over again?<br />Update: the manufacturer will honor the warranty IF i send in the defective struts (have to leave the car up on blocks during the 6 months they say they will take to ""investigate"" the problem and not have a car during this period) then they ""may"" send replacements or not. All the time I will be without a car. What a scam!"
positive,This brake kit seemed to be of very good quality. It had what I needed and everything fit into place as it should. I would recommend and would buy again.
positive,Call me lazy but this tray is a game changer! It holds my items very well and doesn’t make it uncomfortable to sit in the driver seat at all . 10/10 recommend
positive,Great Product!; Highly Recommend
positive,"Quality cargo carrier for a reasonable price. If your looking for a cargo carrier that's long enough and sturdy then this is it. Easy to assemble and mount,  About a 30 min installation. Delivered and shipped right on time. Satisfied with the product and service and would recommend to anyone looking for a cargo carrier."
positive,"These look awesome on my Duke 200, great complement to the KTM style. They are light, durable and easy to install."
positive,Bosch
positive,Tested on my floor boards this blocks about 15-20 degrees of heat. An effective thermal layer it sticks well to clean painted interior floors. It is difficult to conform to reinforcing ribbing embossed on floor boards but that was not a concern for me overall.  This is much more effective than rubber/foil liners as it is more of a thermal blocker.
positive,Very good quality and fit.
positive,"A quick, easy replacement on a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. you will need a T-40 torx bit to remove the factory lift supports."
positive,"I got it for my wife,  I bought her a 2015 Certified Preowned Toyota RAV4 for Mothers Day.  Of course the dealership had nothing."
positive,"It's a standard ball mount, but unlike my older draw-tite mount this was made in china. Besides that it is a perfectly good hitch, I just plan to get a Curt one because my friend received his and his was made in USA and the price is the same so I'm planning on buying that instead."
positive,"Seem to o be working ,had one that was giving erratic readings but Mopeka customer service replaced it. It definitely keeps the guessing game away are they  90-100 percent accurate, time will tell."
positive,"I only went 4 stars because of the scent it leaves. Its Not overwhelming its just not my favorite scent. That being said its a great cleaner and as the other reviews stated it doesn't leave that greasy kinda film on. The one that collects every bit of dust around. Gives it a nice clean look and its not all shiny and helps keep down the interior reflections. I only had time to do half or less of my car but i was impressed. This should go a long way as well, I didnt use hardly any. Only true suggestion, offer other scents. Just not pina colada either. Please not that."
positive,Exact fit in my 87 turbo coupe. Came with the gasket.
positive,Perfect fit for c-300
positive,Fits very nicely very good product
positive,"over the years I've watched a lot of wax Products  come and go and a lot of claims made. But this has been the best and most consistent wax product I have use for my cars and trucks.  it goes on smooth and easy, wipes off smooth and easy, lasts an entire season. Usually I double wax so don't have to relax for an entire year.<br /><br />Bottom Line: smooth on, smooth wipe off, long tough shine. Easily earns *****5***** Stars!"
positive,"Arrived on time, easily peels from backing and easy to apply - looks exactly like the picture."
negative,I bought the. Healer brand before and it seemed to work better. I did not notice anything with this.
positive,"The soap foams up like crazy in a foam cannon. The tire cleaner also works well. The only issue I had was getting the tire shine to pump up. After about 30 pumps it finally started. It does not keep the tires shiny for long. Within a few hours I was not impressed by how much it lost it's shine.<br /><br />So I had some wins with the car soap and almost all the other products, just the tire shine was a disappointment."
negative,Arrived scratched and was way overpriced.  Wouldn't buy it again.
positive,"I had a fram filter with a hole in the canister and it was painted over. No marks on paint.. I did not notice it until it was in the car shooting oil out..Nice mess that was.. The store did not question my return an hour later like well thats normal..  So pay a little more or get it for the same price on amazon,,  Paranoid i always check for a filter leak now..  Mobil one has treated me very well.."
positive,Very happy
positive,"Prefect, easy to use, have had it for at least a year hasn't failed yet"
negative,The mats arrived and the yellow  Batman symbol was faded.  Not really happy 😕
positive,Fits a 2015 Chevy Impala.  Looks and feels sturdy compared to the original.  Only question was there were two clamps included but three were needed.  Had to order a specific size clamp.
positive,Easy to wisk in my dogs mouth after I brush their teeth  plus easy before they go to bed. I feel after I brush this removes excess tartar
positive,It works.
positive,Excellent.
positive,Would give it 5 stars if it came with bulb placement locations. Marked packages or a schematic.
negative,"Not as plush as photo and Velcro u derisi de, not what was expected but may be better for slipping."
positive,"love love love my sticker. fairly easy application. sticks well, have had no issues thus far. overall, very good product."
positive,My friends are the only ones that never have to ask &#34;which trash can is for recycling?&#34;  It's labeled!!!
positive,These work great to keep plates from rusting.
negative,"Doesn't have strong enough magnetic pull....won't stick to surface. Good idea, poor execution. Overpriced for the quality."
positive,We were selling our van and were able to change out all 4 sensors for the new buyer.
positive,"used these for an older high milage volvo. wanted a quality filter for transitioning to a full synthetic oil. 15,000 between oil changes with a filter change at 7500 miles. fram has always been a quality filter. amazon has excellent prices on most everything."
negative,fluid looks good but the seals on the 4 jugs i bought were so old they broke down and were failing when i took the lid off. i clearly got old stock but the product still served its purpose well
positive,"This is a truly great product!  Especially for an assembly-line worker.  The blinking LED’s that tell you where to plug in the probes is fantastic!  Auto-ranging allows more functions on the dial, which is less confusing for the user.  Large display, great stand, all together a great tool.<br /><br />Something I wish it had:  backlight that stays on until you turn it off.  Yes, I know, eats batteries.  So allow Li-Ion batteries.  Nobody has on/off switch for backlight - it always shuts off just about when I am finally ready to read the display.  Sigh.<br /><br />If I recall correctly, they claim frequency to 15 MHz, but no.  I do not know what frequency the frequency measures, but I would stick to audio.  Other than that, it’s a great value.  We hoped it could measure the voltage output of a small transmitter operating at 7 MHz but it reads 0.  It would have been a nice bonus if it had worked... :)"
positive,No more fault code after installing. Very easy to replace.
positive,I have a few big Klingon Weapons made of stainless steel and they rust if not properly kept.  A little of this naval jelly and I don't have to worry about rust.  I know handling them with gloves is best so oils from your hands don't compromise the metal. However I like touching them so after I play I polish them to a high sheen with this naval jelly About once a year I polish all the stainless in my house except things used for eating. The product works without giving me too much a of workout when polishing.
positive,Arrived quickly and looks just like our little girl Yorkie !!! Love it so much - got it twice !!!
negative,Never could get it to work!
positive,Works well.
negative,Do not purchase anything from WT Transmission !! They do not honor their Warranty and you will be stuck with the broken part !!!!!!!!
positive,Some store is selling this product so expensive but i find great this bought it from here in Amazon. I definitely recommend people who has back pain or drive most of the time should get one of this. It will massage your back while you are driving.
positive,Good book just very expensive for what it is. Could use more pictures and diagrams.
positive,Use this product on all my leather sheaths for my knifes and leather boots. It’s actually really satisfying once you put it on leather and see how much it absorbs and brings leather back from Tearing to pieces
positive,Good fit. No problems.
positive,Great case it mounts great to anything. I haven't mounted two of the small bar on the trailer while I'm cooking I can just snap it in place it just doesn't move the elastic rubber bands that connect to each corner plus the clamp on the side you will not have any problems with your phone flopping out.
positive,"This is a pretty good value helmet. Fits well and as expected based upon the sizing chart. The one thing I don’t like is the gloss, it’s pretty flat looking in the photos but has a cheap plastic coating that is shiny. Makes it look super cheap."
positive,"BOUGHT 3, WORKS GREAT."
positive,Have several acrylic shadow boxes that hold family &#34; treasures&#34;.  They gather dust on a daily basis.  Novus polish mates are great for cleaning to prevent pitting and scratching of the acrylic.
positive,Got here when they said.  So far....so good.  I will be ordering more.Thank you
positive,"I love this! It's metal and not flimsy.<br /><br />It has top and bottom holes (I only needed the top, though). It fit better than I expected. Since there were no reviews on this item, I was a bit hesitant.<br /><br />The words are eligible, though I wish they were a bit bigger. I love the mountains and cannot wait to follow their call!<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product - I am not disappointed :)."
positive,Great for security while in storage and great for stabilization.
positive,"I bought this for a recent wheeling trip. I wanted to make sure I had some protection for my tire for any drop offs. First off, I like Body Armor 4x4, because they are US made. This was another great win. Solid made. I only wish it was a bit longer, but believe I'd still give me enough slide to keep from damaging my tire/tire carrier."
positive,very good
positive,Speedy delivery. Cannot rate performance because I have yet to use it. Cute small compact box.
positive,Shipped lightning fast and perfect condition.  I have gotten brass ones before elsewhere and they were scratched and knicked. ...great place<br />Thank you
positive,Nice product. The green color makes it easier to differentiate among the slew of yellows out there.  My only gripe is that Amazon Prime took their non-Prime time getting it to our local Amazon locker.
positive,Purchased this to use on our acrylic fish tank. Worked great with a polisher! This is by far the cheapest you will find. In town they are $10-$12 a bottle.
negative,Hard to get on and use. My old metal one was much better
positive,Catches all that god-awful sticky stuff and keeps hard pieces from sliding around in a little cubbies works well
positive,Perfect fit for 2007 Ford F150 5.4L no leaks
positive,"Hard to say how good it works since the boots are suppose to be water proof anyway. I used this on my work boots, it darkens your boots (it does tell you it may darken your boots). Seems to help though. I did use the oven trick as people talk about and it worked good. You will get a couple pairs of boots out of each jar (probably 4). I would probably buy again."
positive,"This Headlight was the perfect solution for the fogged up ones on my Sienna.  It's a little tricky getting the old one out and the new one in without taking off the front plastic bumper but it is absolutely possible.  I changed both left and right but had to loosen the fender screws to permit the light to be removed and installed.  It is like a puzzle, once you get the angle right, they fall right in.  They also came with brand new bulbs.  These are less than half of the OEM Headlights and work just as well."
positive,"Everything arrived in good shape, and the wheel/tire is just fine - exactly as shown in the pictures.  My only gripe is that the mounting bracket they include doesn't come with instructions, and if you aren't familiar with how they work, you probably have no hope whatsoever of getting it to work without seeing some pictures of it.  SO, don't bother to try to figure it out by yourself - go online and see what it looks like - then installing is a breeze!"
positive,Excellent for an older oil burner wouldn't recommend it for a newer automobile very thick
positive,"Installed on f250, even my wife, being a passenger immediately noticed a difference in ride and handling.<br />2021 f250 stock tires and height"
positive,I purchased these but didn’t work on my truck.
positive,Really cool and price could not be better.
positive,"Nice metal and polishing, holding to the remote control tight. Recommended if you don't want spend $45 for something similar from AudiUSA Store......"
negative,"Worked on my 1997 Ford F-150, But the plastic used could be a better quality. I would have given it 5 stars if the plastic used was of a better less brittle quality also there were NO instruction's. Even though easy to install there should be instructions. I installed three with no problems however when I tightened the screws down on the last one the plastic just broke apart. Don't know why."
positive,Nice sponge.
positive,My only brand of lubes when I care
positive,Great deal
positive,Worked as it should.
positive,"The only thing that let me know that these are budget hand guards was the poor job de-burring some of the metal pieces. They are just as strong as tusk or acerbis hand guards that I have owned in the past. The installation was the same as any set of bark busters, a little bit of force and bending here and there is necessary. The plastic portions look good and compliment the bike nicely. I'll keep buying these over the name brand ones any day."
positive,The hitch cover is really nice for our Nissan Rogue. Easy to install.
positive,Works great on my 2005 g35 Sedan. Big difference in suspension feel.
positive,"I have a set of these mats front and rear in two of our 2013 cayenne diesels and they are great.  Much easier to clean than weathertech.  I tend to drive barefoot a lot and the mats are much more comfortable on the feet as well.  I prefer the smoother surface design and the logos don’t fall off like the weathertech ones did.  The black is nice and the tan matches savanna beige well.  I also have the cargo liner in one cayenne.  It’s much more grippy than the oem all weather liner but it doesn’t have the high sides to catch spills, more of a design choice but worth noting if you are trying to decide between the two.  The also stick to the carpet well.  The rear passenger mat is a single piece which helps with the kids."
positive,Fit as advertized
positive,Great adhesive for install bright led easy to install
negative,These headlights have no aiming ability. Waste of money. Don't be like me; do a little more research before you order.
positive,Buen repuesto para cambio de aceite
negative,BAD PRODUCT WASTE OF MONEY
positive,This was a good replacement...perfect fit and solved the illusive noise from this area...even when the old one when removed appeared to be ok.
positive,Perfect
positive,Worked just like the one that came with the truck
positive,Fit perfectly on my 2006 Forest River Wildwood travel trailer.
positive,Perfect fit.
positive,These wiper blades seam like they are good quality.  I've only had them on for one day though so time will tell. Installation was a snap. Highly recommended.
positive,Has not failed me yet
positive,Very strong not flimsy like other licence  plate frames I have bought before on Amazon. I highly recommend these. Will buy more soon.
positive,Does exactly what it says. I couldn't see not having one.
positive,"fit perfect on '12 4Runner, no drilling needed."
positive,I like that you get a lot for you money
positive,I wish this product work as well on me when I get up in the morning as it does my truck... my truck can be feeling dead as hell but after a short time this gets my truck back to life.
positive,"I liked the blocking of our strong afternoon sun (yes, even in the winter).  Wh"
positive,"Fit well.  Easy install.  Performs as advertised.  Pricey for what it is, but not for what it does."
positive,"After one year of being exposed to the Florida Sunshine, they fade away very quickly. So expect on repurchasing this set every year. However, if you keep your car in the garage, I would say that you could probably have this for 2 years before replacing it due to the color faded"
positive,Worked perfectly for my 2006 Titan. Took maybe 4 minutes to install both. It couldn’t have been easier. Just follow the easy instructions that came with the struts.
positive,Great price and value.
positive,Easy Peasy. Perfect fit for my Cub Cadet LTX1050.
positive,Great gift
positive,Looks great on my vehicle
positive,"Keeps us from slipping on the concrete, which was the point. However leaves get stuck in it, and grinded in, it requires our maid service to have to sweep it every week.  (I purchased for our company)<br /><br />Was this review helpful?  If so, please click the helpful button and help me stand out in all these reviews.  Thanks!"
positive,Installation was easy.
positive,"All of the stitch-up wheel covers are a long, tedious pain in the arse to install, that's just the nature of them. But WELL worth the time to do it right. They sometimes feel like they're too small to fit over a wheel (I've installed two of these now, both were a fight to get them over the circumference, but once on and stitched, you know why it's tight to get over the wheel in the first place. Oh, use the baseball stitch (two-needles, crossing, look up on U-tube), it's even more of a PITA to do, but worth it when finished."
positive,"I bought this clock to put on the dashboard of my boat, and it is perfect.  It takes up very little space, and if you did not know it was an add-on to the boat you would assume it was original equipment.  It was very easy to install and set the time.  I will be curious to see how long the battery lasts, and how difficult it will be to replace the battery."
positive,"Installed great, didnt need the extension some say you do. Looking forward to easy changes! Why this is the first car I'm putting it in and not sooner, I have no idea. Oh this is my first vehicle with a high clearance lol"
positive,It's a must have for break jobs if you don't have a sand blaster. So I bought both sizes. Love them.
positive,One can make small tweaks and fine tune the position/angle.
positive,Foam applicator works well and wax is great.  The draw back is the bulk of the foam applicator but this can be expected.  I like the to becuase you don't waste wax like if you use just a suction use like my pressure washer has.
positive,This makes cleaning the windows in my car way easier than it ever has been. It's easy to use and reaches into the corners. Does a good job with no streaking. Finally my windows are clean!
positive,"Edited: so I tried again with the shortest adapter. Though it is super short, I am able to screw in a few mm into the port. No gaps. And it has decent reception from where I am at. Not 100% but most stations are decent. I'd say 90% clear. But for a shorter antenna, it looks nice.<br /><br />Tried all of the adapters, none of them fit but one that made it stick out more than the gapping piece that it came with. I don't mind going to the hardware store to find the fitting piece but overall it's inconvenient to what I paid."
positive,"I too bought the wrong sensor and of course the expensive one was the one I needed. The text on the back isn't the same as what is pictured but it has the same plastic ford gray rear cover and I can't find any other brands that have that so I assume it's genuine and maybe a new revision or something. Not complaining, it turned off my light and I got it used half price and it looks and works great."
positive,Fits perfectly in my small tool kit on my Motorcycle.  Have not used it and hopefully never will.
positive,I just put these on my Kawasaki Vulcan Nomad.  I love them.  Almost identical to the Kuryakyn pegs at half the price.
positive,I love my head rest covers! Great purchase. Delivery fast.
positive,On Keystone 29BHS. Simple install will last life of RV.  Get it. Makes it a 10 minute job.
positive,"Exactly what I needed. Worked perfect, saved me a lot of money. Arrived on time, in perfect condition."
positive,GREAT DEAL
positive,"If you have any kind of grime, grossness, or just dirt in general on your car interior/exterior glass, than this product is perfect. Sprays on with a foam, a few elbow greased swipes and it's like nothing was ever there. 5 stars due to how simple and quick this product works !"
positive,"This is a great set. They work well. I did find that the frozen peas I buy are just small enough to fit into the spaces of the slotted spoon. The flipper works great. I had no issues with anything in this set. I was surprised at how sturdy they seem. I was thinking they would be a bit flimsy, where they are silicone. They are not, they so have the flex that silicone does have. All around great set.<br /><br />I got his at a discount in exchange for an honest review."
positive,Worked as described and added much needed counter space to our RV.  Seems to be high quality and will last a long time.  We leave it in place on every trip and has never moved.
