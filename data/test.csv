I have had the license plate holders for a couple months but I didn't want to review them until I took my car through the car wash. I removed the original license plate holders that came with my car and when I went through the car wash the large swishing brushes bent my license plates. I knew I wanted a holder that was sleek looking and that would be tough enough to withstand the car wash. I am very pleased to say they are exactly what I wanted and have held up without an incident. I am very pleased and would recommend.,NA,NA
I just installed this in my car today. It works great but was larger in diameter than my previous socket.  I had to spend some time widening the opening so that this would fit through. Other than that I would give this 5 stars.,NA,NA

"Many complaints I have read here are related to difficulty of installation/tightening of the nutsert assembly. I agree that Step 2 of the DZ-43200 instruction sheet dated 09/25/2013 is inadequate at best, misleading at worst. So here is a tip that should help to overcome most if not all nutsert installation issues.  First, ignore the language the Step 2 that state the nutsert should be tightened nine 360 degree turns. Instead, just temporarily snug it up  so that it grips itself onto the tailgate. Next, move on to Step 3. IMPORTANT: You must follow Step 3 to the letter including ""Torque to 8 ft-lbs with 13mm socket"".  Doing so will simultaneously complete the tightening of the nutset to the same 8 ft-lbs torque.<br />The properly installed product works great on my F150. I give five stars for performance but I am deducting a star for poor documentation and another because I am skeptical about the durability of the product. It just does not seem heavy-duty enough to pass the test of time.",NA,NA

Have a truck with 6 year on the factory battery. I know any day it will meet its end. Bought one of these for several reason. ! being the truck 2. being my ride on lawn mower battery seems to get weak during the winter (live in Florida so need it year round) and three I attend several sporting events and my friends always seem to leave something on and post game they are dead in the parking lot. This unit has been a life saver.<br /><br />1/26/2015 UPDATE. This unit is 2 plus years old now and still works like new. I've had several jump packs over the years and this one has been the best I've ever owned.,NA,NA

"Plugs is plugs ... but now I know that's not the case. If you leave the plug choice to `least expensive', or your mechanic, you will likely see little change in vehicle performance. That's been my years of experience.<br /><br />I was intrigued by a scientific journal article that considered various `spark plug' designs in combustion system dynamics. From that curiosity, I went to looking for the `optimum' plug at the best price for my latest plug change. There are cheap, middle and premium plugs to be considered. If you are going to spend the time on the knuckle-busting job of changing the plugs, why not put the 'best' plugs in?<br /><br />Iridium plugs trump platinum plugs simply from iridium's place on the periodic chart of elements. I considered the `super-premium' plugs that incorporate mini-subsystems that can run up to $25 a pop. The high dollar, mini-system plugs incorporate inherently superior spark dynamics in the ignition cycle. But, on deeper consideration after checking the engine specs on-line... your vehicle's OEM computer will suppress these advantages in the 'greater' vehicle combustion optimization equation ... super-plugs require a super, non-OEM computer, to unlock the plugs capability. The high dollar, super-plug will be dumbed down by the OEM vehicle's computer.<br /><br />So, I went the middling route for my Lincoln Navigator by shifting my electrodes one element left in the periodic chart and looked for the least expensive plug in that category. I watch fuel consumption and was amazed that these plugs upped the mileage over 10%. There are just not that many ways to get a real 10% improvement in mileage.<br /><br />5-star ... the results exceeded my expectations. I received all 8 in one order.  The odd-number purchase problem another reviewer provided must have been corrected.",NA,NA

"For a bumper hitch, this one is pretty good.  It is primarily bolted to the bumper and is stabilized at the wheel well, where it is bolted through the drain plug holes.  Although I would prefer the hitch to be more recessed under the car, it does not stick out past the bumper.  It is not possible to recess it further (hits the the gas tank).<br /><br />Mine is on a Sentra, so I could not expect to test its 2000lb claims, but I'm sure that it will handle the bike rack I'm using.  Installation is not hard but cumbersome, and removing the bumper shell is a good idea - however, you will still need to use the included bolt-snaking spring tool even with the bumper removed.  I used a jack to lift the hitch into position and hold it there while putting the bolts through the wheel well.",NA,NA
Great as you would expect from BOSCH!,NA,NA
I was amazed at how easy this product was to install. My camper door was already outfitted for it. Nothing to remove. I simply had to push one portion to the top of the frame and lock it with the little locking tabs and do the same for the bottom. That’s it. It seems to work very good.,NA,NA

"This set includes every combination that you might need to securely install license plates on your car. The included machine screws fit the factory holes on my Japanese produced Lexus. They offer piece of mind that your license plate, aftermarket back up camera, or fancy license plate frame will not be stolen by some random thief.  The plastic caps that cover the security screws are a nice touch to prevent corrosion. One great benefit of this set is that in addition to containing the special Allen wrench, it also includes an Allen wrench bit for use in a driver drill or screw driver that accepts but tips. That made installation fast and easy. I pair these with a silicone plate cover from Amazon to prevent rattling and scratches to my car.  This set is an excellent value, and contains enough hardware for me to do two vehicles (no front plate in my state).  I hope this review is helpful in your decision making. Thanks.",NA,NA

"So far these have been fantastic on my 2003 Mean Streak. One bag sits on the exhaust, but the pipes have slip on covers so the bags are safe from the heat. Just to be safe I added an adhesive heat shield from Amazon to the bottom of the bag. I rode a week before I received the heat shield and the bag was fine so I doubt it was needed.<br /><br />The bags are huge, and I can literally fit the old bags inside these. I didn't think I'd ever need the exterior pockets, but I've already put them to use with spare hoses, tools, and other goodies.<br /><br />Nothing inside my bags has gotten wet, so I can verify the waterproof ability.<br /><br />The odd shaped lid is actually functional, making it easy to grip near the velcro and lift up.<br /><br />When I took the bags off (very easy to do, by the way) to place the extra heat shield I noticed that there was gouges in the plastic from rubbing against the brackets. That worries me and I may end up bolting them onto bike instead of hanging over the fender.<br /><br />It comes with two locks to keep someone from walking off with the bags and they work ok. I can even use them to lock my helmet to the bike. Bonus! The clasps each have a small plastic lock and they are absolutely worthless, all you have to do is unbuckle the strap. What's the point?<br /><br />I've added a reflector onto both bags to increase my visibility and they don't distract from the bags, in my opinion anyway.",NA,NA

"This was a shot in the dark, but for $12 why not!<br /><br />About a month ago my CEL was popping on and off intermittently.  I had a code reader already I had not one, but two P0420 codes--and one of them was permanent!  I immediately thought it was my cat converter going bad, specifically because of the permanent code.  I did the visual checks and nothing appeared melted or out of sort, so I began to do all the research I could.<br /><br />I tested the temperature and also the O2 sensors and they checked out.  I began to get even more nervous that it was in fact the cat going bad.  I was looking for a legit way to clean the converter without having to take it off.  People had suggested lacquer thinner, but that didnt seem to work for anyone that had actually ran it through their fuel system.  So, I started looking online and this was the only product that had positive reviews beyond belief to actually clean the cat system.  Low and behold.....200 miles later, and no more CEL, it also cleared my permanent code! :O<br /><br />how i did it:<br /><br />Ran my car down to less than a 1/4 of a tank of gas.<br />Poured 1 can of Catalytic Converter Cleaner & Deodorizer into the gas tank. (funnel recommended :) )<br />Ran that 1 tank of gas to about 20 miles left ~.<br />Reset CEL<br />Filled my car back up to a 1/4 tank of gas.<br />Burned that off<br />Refueled to full<br />Hooked up obd2 reader once more to see if P0420 codes were existent at all...Nope, Permanent wasn't even there anymore.<br /><br />Fuel efficiency is actually up a few mpg. went from 25 to 27 mpg and also my car is noticeably more silent when punching the gas.<br /><br />I've been driving for about a week now and it has not popped back up yet.  If you feel like your cat is dirty or dont want to shell out money for a new O2 or even a new cat, I would definitely say this is worth the $12.",NA,NA

I didn't especially care for the fact that two of them had (small but noticeable) lines horizontally across them as if they were scratched 'while the paint was wet', so to speak.  I haven't contacted the seller because it's no so bad I want to put them through the whole replacement scenario, but I feel fairly certain it wouldn't be a problem if I did.

"When I opened the box (no damage), the vinyl wrap was tore open, and there were minor scratches.  However, I bought this as a spare and since this is not a cosmetic part, I'll keep it.  The genuine Honda is about $300, this one was about $86 at the time of purchase, so it is a great value for the money.  It is made in Taiwan, but a lot of Honda/Acura's genuine parts are made in Taiwan (headlight/tail light housing, bumpers, etc...) so the quality is on par with genuine Honda.  I will re-coat it with epoxy-based primer to keep it corrosion-free (generic primers are porous and will not keep moisture away; the only solution is epoxy-based primer).",NA,NA

"My old charger with a voltage meter and rockers switches died so I got this one, which only has indicator lights and soft press buttons.  It works well enough to trickle charge car batteries but you have to pay attention to the light that shows what I can describe as an ""unhappy"" battery with the battery clamps attached to it.  You must make sure that that light doesn't come on after a few seconds, otherwise you're wasting your time and the battery wouldn't charge.  I thought I had the clamps on the battery terminals secure enough but ended up have to wiggle them around until the Unhappy Battery light went out - didn't think the terminals were particularly dirty or oily, but there it is.  It's only so-so on hot shotting a car with a dead battery; my portable battery pack works much better.",NA,NA

"Cheaply made and doing a poor job of staying on my seats. The little plastic hooks that hold it in around the back bent, allowing it to come off.

I can't say how often it needs to be recharged.<br />It is nice and small, easy to store in your car without taking up much room.

"Having a mini trash can in the car is a game-changer. This has been so helpful in keeping the car clean and the black looks nice. I've had no problems with it since getting it and my partner will be getting one for her car as well. It is compact, so obviously you can't fit a car full of large fast-food cups. However, the biggest difference is the small things that you may forget to bring in or think that it is not that big of a deal to leave until you do that over and over again. The pocket is also helpful if you want to put hand sanitizer or napkins to help with overall cleanliness.",NA,NA

It is light weight and it connects very snugly. There was no leakage at all. We are very pleased with this.,NA,NA
"Easy to install, fits great. It made it through multiple rain storms on our way to Key West from South Carolina. All our luggage remained dry. We loved how you can lock the tail gate and no one can get the cover off unless they cut it. It easily folds up when we need to load larger items in the back. Excellent quality, Fast delivery.",NA,NA
At half the price of the local auto parts store it works great.  Removing and replacement took an hour.  Reinstalling the plastic water barrier required straightening out the original and gluing it back in place.  I used 3M 08051 Feathering Disc Adhesive which worked perfectly.  Replacement required drilling out the rivets and if you can borrow the jumbo riveter it is easy.  Buying the special size riveter is silly if you only need it once every 10 years.  Buy the fastener package and use the nuts and bolts.  New plastic pushpins for the door panel are a great idea.  They don't cost much and replacing now is easier than later if a pin is not grabbing like it should.<br /><br />Great value and it works great.,NA,NA
"I had to write a review on this bucket dirt guard. For those who use wash buckets to wash their autos, this wash bucket insert is awesome. I purchased a kit about 2 years ago from another site (geek) and the bucket split on me about two weeks ago. I didn't want to purchase another ""high dollar"" bucket when Lowes/THD should do the job. Interesting thing is the ""high dollar"" bucket folks size their pieces where one cannot use an insert in a cheap bucket, leaving you no choice to buy theirs. So, I've purchased two Lowes' buckets, gamma guard, and this insert for almost the same price of the ""high dollar"" bucket. This product is more robust and I cannot wait to use it this weekend!",NA,NA

"We use this to cover our Harley and use it indoors and outdoors. We've had it for over a year now. It is used outdoors on the few occasions that it rains while my husband has his bike at work. I also keep in on the bike when it is sitting in the garage for extended time such as my husband goes on deployment. Our cover has not come into contact with extended sun exposure or extended rain so we couldn't tell you how well it holds up sitting in the sun for months or if his bike is dry after days in the rain. However, for a pretty big bike it covers it very well and we haven't had an issues with the material ripping or unraveling.",NA,NA

"I usually drink my coffee out of my yeti coffee mug and always found it annoying that the coffee mug does not fit in a normal car cup holder.  The standard cup holder in any car would be too small in diameter to fit my yeti mug.  Till now, if I was to take my coffee to go, I would have to transfer the coffee onto a tumbler and the it to go.  Anyway, I definitely recommend this product as a solution to this problem.  I do wish the piece that sits in the cup holder of the car was a little shorter so the entire product would sit a little more flush, but I guess I can always cut a piece off if it bothers me.  But thank you and I highly recommend.",NA,NA
"I needed this to steady my little travel trailer & I was surprised by the size and weight of them, considering they are made to hold 6000 pounds.<br />They were fairly easy to use and I didn't even really need the instructions. The one thing that was annoying was the length of the crank/tighteners. When I was placing the stands near parts that hung down from the trailer, I had to work a lot slower to keep from bangng into those parts. That is kind of a minor thing though. These were pretty light weight but seem to be doing a good job holding my small trailer. It's nice not to have the slight rocking motion when I am moving around inside the cabin. All in all, this was a great buy.",NA,NA

My Jeep Wrangler's A/C quit working and took it to a shop that diagnosed the problem as it needing a new compressor with some other parts that would be well over $1000.

Love this carrier. Made it through over 700 miles with cold snow ice and rain and not one issue. No noise during ride everything was dry and not damaged. Zipper has flap that covers it to keep rain ice from damaging the zipper.  Make sure to read instructions when install. Also the straps ends have Valero so you can wrap it around the straps after tightening to secure it from wind and you don’t have to knot it. Big plus.

"I have a little roadster and there just isn't room for a small trash container like I have in other cars. I thought I would give these a try and have been massively surprised at how well they work.  I adhered one to the glove box.  I thought it might not stick or it might leave a residue.  So far neither has been the case.  Of course if you put a brick in these you shouldn't expect the seal to hold!  But for normal paper like trash that seems to accumulate in your car these are perfect.'<br />The designs are really cute as well.  I have the black print in my black car and while you can see it, it isn't quite as in your face as is the orange one.  That being said, I think the orange print one is really cute and wouldn't mind it sticking out.<br /> I actually ended up using these on my art cart as well. When you sharpen pencils you end up with a bunch of shavings that are a pain in the rear. If you don't have a trash receptacle close at hand you will undoubtedly end yp with some on the floor.  I just open the bag up, sharpen over top of it, shake out the excess that makes it into the storage container of the sharpener and the mess is gone.  I have hundreds of colored pencils for art projects.  They are stored in what I call my ""art cart"" as I can wheel supplies from one area to another when working easily. (Picture is above.  I affixed the bag to the end closest to where I am working.)  I had used a clear plastic bag before but had to use a giant clip to hold it in place on the cart. (see photo 2).  This is much better looking, works well and needs no extra clip.<br />I think you may find a number of uses.  I can see this being handy next to your sewing machine to catch threads as well.",NA,NA

"I cleaned several rusty tools with this solution. I filled an empty peanut-butter container with as many rusty tools as I could fit, then poured the Evapo-rust into the container. The tools soaked for closer to 24 hours (recommended time is 1-12 hours) but most came out looking fantastic. I used a brass brush on some spots to scrape away scale, but for the most part the Evapo-rust did all the work. See the before-and-after photos of the Craftsman Handi-cut edge cutter (37300) after 24 hours. It looks like the surface treatment (blueing?) was removed in the process.",NA,NA

"Good fit and these goggles can be worn both inside the helmet (putting the goggles on first, then the helmet over the strap) as well as outside (putting the helmet on first and then the goggles over the helmet.)<br />The yellow lens is actually &#34;minus-blue&#34; because this is the color that's being filtered-out. The blue light is much-shorter wavelength, so eliminating it sharpens the vision and increases contrast.<br />The much-larger goggles these replaced, though, offered a little more face-protection in the event of a collision and also fewer gaps for flying insects. Eye protection is good, while more face protection is a little less with these otherwise great goggles.",NA,NA

Usually only happens once after application then it no longer splashes on paint, but the tire stay looking nice.",NA,NA

"These goggles work great when out riding for keeping your vision clear. The lens is clear and without distortions found on some goggles. Also the fit is adjustable and fit even the largest face person (my husband wears a size 8 1/4 hat and these fit him just fine.) The lens resist scratching and is tinted in a medium level of tint, great for riding in the desert when the sun can be overpowering. These lenses do not fog up when out riding keeping your vision clear. The frame is well made and looks great with the multi color finish, and the seal around the goggles does a great job at keeping the dust out. Overall, these are a great pair of goggles for the off-roaders out there.",NA,NA

"Second Unit worked great.  Do not understand way first unit failed.  After I trouble shoot vehicle Including pulling fuse panel and looking for shorts.

GM's OBD2 machine would not read anything so they pulled fuse panel disconnected rear harnesses and checked pins for tightness and corrosion.  After plugging the harness back into the fuse panel the OBD2 port started working.  I have not tried to test the port again.  I will try a less expensive unit before trying the BlueDriver.

"Have enjoyed Blue Ox quality on my Aventa tow-bar for years. Blue Ox completely (and I mean ""completely"") overhauled that tow-bar for me at a Phoenix RV show for less than the expendable hardware would have cost. So.... when I purchased my 2010 Dodge Dakota pickup, I opted for the Blue Ox base-plate. Installation is not terribly complicated, but if you're not willing to get a little dirty, manhandle a 40+ pound piece of ungainly hardware, or if you don't fancy laying on your back on the garage floor drilling eight 17/32"" mounting-holes in the truck forward frame, you might opt for professional installation. You will appreciate an extra set of hands when you fit the base-plate to do your drilling and bolt-up. I meet all the criteria for an old-f--t and I had no real difficulty getting the job done, but ""individual results may vary"". Everything you need (but the tools and some lock-tite) is in the kit from Blue Ox, including pretty decent installation instructions. Should you need assistance, their support-line is very responsive. I HIGHLY recommend their products to anyone who asks, and this tow'd vehicle base-plate is no exception.",NA,NA

"Very easy to install with no drilling and all materials were included for install. Looks very nice on the inside of tailgate of Jeep, and very handy for accessing your items without digging through the vehicle looking for them.  Does not hold as much as I thought.<br />Update: 03-18-16  After using this in my Jeep for a year I am less than impressed.  The main problem is storage.  The bags do not hold enough to warrant the cost of the kit.  I still had to carry a duffle bag with other items.  So I removed the bags and loaded everything into one duffle.  The other problem is, over time the bags began to sag severely and drag on the floor of the Jeep when closing the door.  As well, the weight of the bags constantly pulled away from the plastic hanger they attach to.  I had to run screws into the top of the bags and into their mount in order to keep them on their hangers.  Needless to say, I have since removed these and will probably be getting rid of the altogether.",NA,NA

"I purchased this product to assist with the pain a shoulder belt can cause sometimes.  It works as designed and reasonably priced.  However, not as soft or comfortable as I had hoped.  Also, will occasionally ride up on my shoulder and not cover the belt as I intended.  I might look for another alternative next time.",NA,NA
"Super happy to have our kayaks up and off the floor in unused ""air space"". Easy to bring down and put up. Great purchase.",NA,NA
"Nice simple addition to my trunk. Gotta organize the junk somehow. I think I’d like one with 3 compartments better, but that’s just me thinking out loud. Overall, fine product for a decent price.",NA,NA
The suction cups don't fall of the glass even during hot weather. Holds the tag up nicely and is very compact. No complaints.,NA,NA
"Very unhappy with this.  I can't get the paint to come out of the pen, and if I bang it hard enough on the car, a blob of paint comes out.  Trying to touch up a few nicks I just made a mess that was difficult to clean up.  Threw this away and bought a small jar of touch-up paint and uses a very fine brush.  That worked well.",NA,NA
"Bright LED light, easy to install / connect to a standard hitch wiring adapter (you have to purchase separately).  Wires could have been a little longer.  So far has been weather-resistant.",NA,NA
Had professional install. Good Fit.<br /><br />Update:<br />Half a year later and no issues. I'm still happy with this purchase.,NA,NA
This cover is true to size. It is sturdy and fairly easy to place and position. The buckles are sturdy and the bag is decent. I have some vehicles I drive only in the spring and summer. This cover provides needed protection the rest of the time. Be sure to check the protection.,NA,NA
A much needed improvement over stock on 2004 Rad King. Will buy again.,NA,NA
only used once. seems to work as described,NA,NA
great item,NA,NA
Great product.  Great service.,NA,NA
This happened to be a special when I made the purchase. I grabbed at the bargain and placed the order. Usually I read the reviews first but this had a time factor so I bought it before time ran out. After the purchase I read the reviews. I did not have the leakage problem that others experienced. The package arrived sooner than expected and the contents were perfect.<br /><br />This kit contains everything that I ever use for cleaning my vehicles. These are quality products and do an excellent job. Although I got these at a special price the regular price is not enough more to keep me from reordering when my current supply runs out. Good stuff.,NA,NA
I like the trailer plug in and go deal but still have to wire in the reverse light portion. The instructions have a glitch in them stating the spare wire (not in harness connector) goes to ground. Actually that wire is for the back up lights. We will see how long they last and I will update from there,NA,NA
"Fits perfect on my 2011 Honda Fit, doesn’t help with the heat tho",NA,NA
I purchased this item to take care of a check engine light on my 2008 cadillac cts awd... And it took care of the issue plus much cheaper than the local auto parts store.,NA,NA
"Easy to install, works as expected",NA,NA
I’ve had the lights in for about 3 weeks now and they’re amazing. Not only that but the company is great too. My truck needed the decoders so I contacted the company and hassle free they sent them immediately. Definitely recommend these lights to anyone. Just be aware you might need the decoders.,NA,NA
Good spray wax.,NA,NA
Seat was great!,NA,NA
"Soft Shackles are exactly what the name implies—soft . . . . If you need to tow your car, these will do the job, no extra tools needed and most of all, because they are soft—no damage to your car or truck. They are constructed with a loop over knob design, made of a strong synthetic material. They come in a bright orange bag, so you can easily find them in your trunk. No car, van, or truck should be without them.",NA,NA
"I believe in the KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) principle and this is the simplest, least expensive Toad breaking system that I found. It took a little work to run the cabling in my Jeep Wrangler but it is not to bad. I have taken it out on a couple of trips so far and after adjusting the cable a couple times it works perfect.",NA,NA
Great grips!,NA,NA
Easy to install.  Works very well and is as good or better than my previous Motorcraft branded ones.  If they hold up I would definitely purchase again.,NA,NA
"These are OK.  They seem a bit smaller in diameter and thinner than some of these I have used in the past.  Not sure I'd buy again they seem cheap.  Update-Now that I have used a few of these they don't SEEM cheap, they ARE cheap.  Maybe good for one or two uses then they are toast.",NA,NA
Love using these pads. They work well for polishing(minor cut) and finishing. I have jad a hard time using microfiber wash or pad cleaner on them. The pad just doesnt seem as soft after. I dont mind just tossing because they last fairly long and are priced well compared to foam pads,NA,NA
Put on my 08 Corvette. It's a K&N and everything fit perfect.,NA,NA
the low sulfur diesels do have lubricants but not as much as before the sulfur reduction.  the problem with additives is you dont know if they are beneficial or not,NA,NA
This is too small for a RAM 2500. The metal on the umbrella gets extremely hot and can burn you if you're in 100°+ weather. The handle hangs down and pushed my Hazzard blinker button. It takes a bit getting used to but it seems to work as advertised.,NA,NA
Did not fit our mirrors—,NA,NA
We just got our mattress today!  It arrived faster than we expected.  It was packed VERY well and arrived in perfect condition.  I searched and researched until every mattress started to look the same.  It is SO HARD to buy a mattress on line without trying it out first.  I can say now that I was silly to worry.  This is such a great bed!  We got the 10 inch and it fits perfectly in our motorhome and there's really not that strong of an odor from the memory foam.  I had asked about the firmness/softness and I agree with those who answered me. Its right in the middle.  We are over the moon happy with our purchase and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great bed at a really great price.,NA,NA

"Works great. Sturdy, solid hardware. Not a perfect fit for my camper, but that is more an issue with my camper door than this lock. It's nice to feel a bit more secure with a locking door.",NA,NA

I really love this clock. I purchased one a few years back to put on our mirror in the bathroom to make sure we were on time in the morning. I wanted a second one to put in my daughters bathroom to ensure that bath time wasn't going too long. Unfortunately they didn't carry these in the store I got the first one from so I was very happy to find it here on Amazon. It's unobtrusive and suctions to the mirror so I don't have to worry about attaching Velcro or double-sided tape which is nice for us renters.,NA,NA
Easy to use. Cleans mediocre,NA,NA

"These hit machining bosses in AMC 360-401 (and prob most other AMC blocks) heads in the middle valves, the two ends have a web cast into the head that these hit (see pics), so exactly NONE will sit flush or be bolted down. A few minutes at a grinder will ""fix"" them so they'll work, but..., I bought to bolt on, not to fabricate...",NA,NA
These don’t fit right. They are a little big . For the price I expected a much better fit.,NA,NA
Really impressive output with these. Would and have already recommended.<br />see photo below. this is running only the fog lights (and consequently the orange parking lights- obvioiusly not a factor here )<br />2014 Silverado,NA,NA

Perfect fit. Already greased seal. Fast shipping,NA,NA

It's super good very very nice it's  real worth even more.i like it .i will 1000% buy it again,NA,NA
As advertised.,NA,NA
The lock seem to be durable but I dont know what weakness on this product is until actual crooks mess with it. My other fear is it doesnt matter what lock you use for trailer the truck can back up and wrap the trailer on hitch with chain and pull it<br />I was thinking to put some sort of wheel security/lock as well.,NA,NA
Bought it for a friend who’s older dog had to be put to sleep. Now she can keep her dog with her wherever she goes. She loved it!,NA,NA

"It does the job but looks cheap.  I ended up cutting all the elastic off the bottom.  This is an inside dust cover so  wind is not an issue.  The elastic snagged on my pipes, mirrors and made removal and installation a pain.  Even with those limitations, it works well enough that I am keeping it and am satisfied enough to keep using it.",NA,NA
"Great and way cheaper than the Bluesea version, which as far as I can tell, is exactly the same.",NA,NA
"This review is for the 600AMP model which is no longer available, but otherwise identical to this model.<br /><br />I've had mine for 2yrs 2mos and up until today I've only used it to recharge other devices, then recharge itself just to keep it in motion, so to speak. It's always taken a recharge to 100% with no problems. I leave it in the trunk of my car and every 3 month or so I check it - it's usually drops to 50-80% just sitting there.<br /><br />Today I had to use it to jump my car for the first time and it worked like a charm. My battery is under the back seat, so I used the power connections under the hood - per manufacturer's instructions. It took several tries before the clamps got a good connection, but when they did the car fired right up no problem.<br /><br />After the jump, the power level still read 100% !!!<br /><br />It's really nice to have a product - any product - that actually works and doesn't let you down.",NA,NA
Very cheesy but thats what i wanted,NA,NA
I bought this for the console on my Bronco Sport and it fits perfectly. Helps to protect the console (especially since I lean on mine and ended up wearing the leather on my previous vehicle leading to cracking) and it is super comfortable. Just the right amount of plush.,NA,NA
"Product seems good, although the price seems a bit high for what it is.<br /><br />Overall seems like decent quality and like the design should work.<br /><br />I’ll update if anything changes after it’s been used more!",NA,NA

"I just installed this rotor on my Alero, the front brakes are so much better now. I used the ACDelco ceramic pads and bedded the pads in with a few miles of light braking. I'm really happy with the fit and finish of the rotors.<br /><br />Update after a few months: This rotor has surface rusted fairly quickly, a bit more than I had hoped. The actual braking surface is clean, but the non-swept areas are quite rusty.",NA,NA
Fits,NA,NA
"The image for this product is incorrect as it is showing an air filter not the package of two plastic retaining clips for 1990''s GM style heater hose quick disconnects.  Package contains two different sizes one for 800-401 quick disconnect and one for the larger 800-402.  These are just the plastic clips that hold the pipe into the quick disconnect fitting.  These are often brittle and break during removal.  You can just replace the plastic clip or buy the entire quick disconnect fitting which comes with a new clip.

"I love this hood protector.  However not exactly what I was expecting, I was expecting the ones more like you see from weathertech that stick up some from the hood and are larger.  This one fits flush against the paint.  It is fairly easy to install, you just have to follow the instructions very carefully.  We did not require some special instrument they said you needed to remove the rubber sealant things.  Just used a flat head to help get them out.",NA,NA
Good,NA,NA
"I bought this several months ago thinking my clutch would need replacing in my civic after 130k miles. Well, I'm over 160k miles on the original clutch and it's still fine. Being that exedy makes Hondas factory clutches, I'm sure this one will function as it should.",NA,NA
