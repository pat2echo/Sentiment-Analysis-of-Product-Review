I have had the license plate holders for a couple months but I didn't want to review them until I took my car through the car wash. I removed the original license plate holders that came with my car and when I went through the car wash the large swishing brushes bent my license plates. I knew I wanted a holder that was sleek looking and that would be tough enough to withstand the car wash. I am very pleased to say they are exactly what I wanted and have held up without an incident. I am very pleased and would recommend.,positive,positive
I bought 2 pairs for my grandsons and both were too small so I‚Äôm returning and buying a size up. These run true to size I just made the mistake of ordering same size I did 6 months ago and they‚Äôve grown!  The pants are very high quality and are super cool,negative,negative

"This is the forth sticker that I have purchased. One for each car. They only last for about a year before they start to fall apart. I proud to be a Viet Nam Veteran,but this will be my last purchase of these stickers.",negative,positive
