both_positive_with_emoji,Fit good for my 2021 Toyota Camry . Recommend üëç,positive,positive
both_positive_text_only,I have had the license plate holders for a couple months but I didn't want to review them until I took my car through the car wash. I removed the original license plate holders that came with my car and when I went through the car wash the large swishing brushes bent my license plates. I knew I wanted a holder that was sleek looking and that would be tough enough to withstand the car wash. I am very pleased to say they are exactly what I wanted and have held up without an incident. I am very pleased and would recommend.,positive,positive
both_positive_text_only,I just installed this in my car today. It works great but was larger in diameter than my previous socket.  I had to spend some time widening the opening so that this would fit through. Other than that I would give this 5 stars.,positive,positive
both_positive_text_only,"Takes up a lot of room between the seats but for the first time in my 30 years as a truck driver, I can keep ice cream in the truck!",positive,positive
both_negative_text_only,I bought 2 pairs for my grandsons and both were too small so I‚Äôm returning and buying a size up. These run true to size I just made the mistake of ordering same size I did 6 months ago and they‚Äôve grown!  The pants are very high quality and are super cool,negative,negative
both_negative_text_only,This cable is flimsy and the casing is very weak.  After pulling it a few times the casing collapsed in on itself and now is hanging loose.  Piece of junk.,negative,negative
both_negative_text_only,These are a little large for a VW Jetta but still work.  I'm able to see my side view mirrors and that is important.  I've not driven in early morning sun yet and that will be the test.,negative,negative

dis_positive_text_only,"Plugs is plugs ... but now I know that's not the case. If you leave the plug choice to `least expensive', or your mechanic, you will likely see little change in vehicle performance. That's been my years of experience.<br /><br />I was intrigued by a scientific journal article that considered various `spark plug' designs in combustion system dynamics. From that curiosity, I went to looking for the `optimum' plug at the best price for my latest plug change. There are cheap, middle and premium plugs to be considered. If you are going to spend the time on the knuckle-busting job of changing the plugs, why not put the 'best' plugs in?<br /><br />Iridium plugs trump platinum plugs simply from iridium's place on the periodic chart of elements. I considered the `super-premium' plugs that incorporate mini-subsystems that can run up to $25 a pop. The high dollar, mini-system plugs incorporate inherently superior spark dynamics in the ignition cycle. But, on deeper consideration after checking the engine specs on-line... your vehicle's OEM computer will suppress these advantages in the 'greater' vehicle combustion optimization equation ... super-plugs require a super, non-OEM computer, to unlock the plugs capability. The high dollar, super-plug will be dumbed down by the OEM vehicle's computer.<br /><br />So, I went the middling route for my Lincoln Navigator by shifting my electrodes one element left in the periodic chart and looked for the least expensive plug in that category. I watch fuel consumption and was amazed that these plugs upped the mileage over 10%. There are just not that many ways to get a real 10% improvement in mileage.<br /><br />5-star ... the results exceeded my expectations. I received all 8 in one order.  The odd-number purchase problem another reviewer provided must have been corrected.",positive,negative
dis_positive_text_only,If you keep it by mistake like I did and you want to use it again after the first time then you have to pay $5 if you want a decent program you have to pay $15 at the point I read that I had my neighbor young man to see how far over in the cow pasture he can throw it I suggest you don't buy one to begin with,positive,negative
gen_positive_text_only,"This is the forth sticker that I have purchased. One for each car. They only last for about a year before they start to fall apart. I proud to be a Viet Nam Veteran,but this will be my last purchase of these stickers.",negative,positive

gen_positive_text_only,"This was a shot in the dark, but for $12 why not!<br /><br />About a month ago my CEL was popping on and off intermittently.  I had a code reader already I had not one, but two P0420 codes--and one of them was permanent!  I immediately thought it was my cat converter going bad, specifically because of the permanent code.  I did the visual checks and nothing appeared melted or out of sort, so I began to do all the research I could.<br /><br />I tested the temperature and also the O2 sensors and they checked out.  I began to get even more nervous that it was in fact the cat going bad.  I was looking for a legit way to clean the converter without having to take it off.  People had suggested lacquer thinner, but that didnt seem to work for anyone that had actually ran it through their fuel system.  So, I started looking online and this was the only product that had positive reviews beyond belief to actually clean the cat system.  Low and behold.....200 miles later, and no more CEL, it also cleared my permanent code! :O<br /><br />how i did it:<br /><br />Ran my car down to less than a 1/4 of a tank of gas.<br />Poured 1 can of Catalytic Converter Cleaner & Deodorizer into the gas tank. (funnel recommended :) )<br />Ran that 1 tank of gas to about 20 miles left ~.<br />Reset CEL<br />Filled my car back up to a 1/4 tank of gas.<br />Burned that off<br />Refueled to full<br />Hooked up obd2 reader once more to see if P0420 codes were existent at all...Nope, Permanent wasn't even there anymore.<br /><br />Fuel efficiency is actually up a few mpg. went from 25 to 27 mpg and also my car is noticeably more silent when punching the gas.<br /><br />I've been driving for about a week now and it has not popped back up yet.  If you feel like your cat is dirty or dont want to shell out money for a new O2 or even a new cat, I would definitely say this is worth the $12.",negative,positive
