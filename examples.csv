both_positive_with_emoji,Fit good for my 2021 Toyota Camry . Recommend üëç,positive,positive
both_positive_text_only,I have had the license plate holders for a couple months but I didn't want to review them until I took my car through the car wash. I removed the original license plate holders that came with my car and when I went through the car wash the large swishing brushes bent my license plates. I knew I wanted a holder that was sleek looking and that would be tough enough to withstand the car wash. I am very pleased to say they are exactly what I wanted and have held up without an incident. I am very pleased and would recommend.,positive,positive
both_positive_text_only,I just installed this in my car today. It works great but was larger in diameter than my previous socket.  I had to spend some time widening the opening so that this would fit through. Other than that I would give this 5 stars.,positive,positive

both_negative_text_only,I bought 2 pairs for my grandsons and both were too small so I‚Äôm returning and buying a size up. These run true to size I just made the mistake of ordering same size I did 6 months ago and they‚Äôve grown!  The pants are very high quality and are super cool,negative,negative

both_negative_text_only,"Many complaints I have read here are related to difficulty of installation/tightening of the nutsert assembly. I agree that Step 2 of the DZ-43200 instruction sheet dated 09/25/2013 is inadequate at best, misleading at worst. So here is a tip that should help to overcome most if not all nutsert installation issues.  First, ignore the language the Step 2 that state the nutsert should be tightened nine 360 degree turns. Instead, just temporarily snug it up  so that it grips itself onto the tailgate. Next, move on to Step 3. IMPORTANT: You must follow Step 3 to the letter including ""Torque to 8 ft-lbs with 13mm socket"".  Doing so will simultaneously complete the tightening of the nutset to the same 8 ft-lbs torque.<br />The properly installed product works great on my F150. I give five stars for performance but I am deducting a star for poor documentation and another because I am skeptical about the durability of the product. It just does not seem heavy-duty enough to pass the test of time.",negative,negative
dis_positive_text_only,"Plugs is plugs ... but now I know that's not the case. If you leave the plug choice to `least expensive', or your mechanic, you will likely see little change in vehicle performance. That's been my years of experience.<br /><br />I was intrigued by a scientific journal article that considered various `spark plug' designs in combustion system dynamics. From that curiosity, I went to looking for the `optimum' plug at the best price for my latest plug change. There are cheap, middle and premium plugs to be considered. If you are going to spend the time on the knuckle-busting job of changing the plugs, why not put the 'best' plugs in?<br /><br />Iridium plugs trump platinum plugs simply from iridium's place on the periodic chart of elements. I considered the `super-premium' plugs that incorporate mini-subsystems that can run up to $25 a pop. The high dollar, mini-system plugs incorporate inherently superior spark dynamics in the ignition cycle. But, on deeper consideration after checking the engine specs on-line... your vehicle's OEM computer will suppress these advantages in the 'greater' vehicle combustion optimization equation ... super-plugs require a super, non-OEM computer, to unlock the plugs capability. The high dollar, super-plug will be dumbed down by the OEM vehicle's computer.<br /><br />So, I went the middling route for my Lincoln Navigator by shifting my electrodes one element left in the periodic chart and looked for the least expensive plug in that category. I watch fuel consumption and was amazed that these plugs upped the mileage over 10%. There are just not that many ways to get a real 10% improvement in mileage.<br /><br />5-star ... the results exceeded my expectations. I received all 8 in one order.  The odd-number purchase problem another reviewer provided must have been corrected.",positive,negative

dis_positive_text_only,Not bad,positive,negative
gen_positive_text_only,super happy with the end result that this paint provided,negative,positive
gen_positive_text_only,These are a little large for a VW Jetta but still work.  I'm able to see my side view mirrors and that is important.  I've not driven in early morning sun yet and that will be the test.,negative,positive
